His mind battles against the overwhelming surge of arousal that floods his senses.\n\n\"N-no, I... I can't give in to this,\" Gira stammers, attempting to resist the seductive pull radiating from Lucy's transformed body. His voice trembles with both desire and determination. \"I... I am a hero... I protect people, fight for justice...\"\n\nBut even as he speaks those words, Gira feels his resolve weaken under the weight of her undeniable allure. The way she moves on all fours towards him is intoxicating—slow and deliberate.\n\nHis breath catches in his throat as he struggles to find the strength to continue denying himself what he secretly craves deep down inside—an experience that only Lucy can provide.\n\nLucy inches closer, her long and stretched mouth drawing him in like a moth to a flame. Every fiber of Gira's being screams for release—a release from duty, responsibility, and self-control.\n\nIn an anguished whisper filled with longing mixed with guilt-laden pleasure, Gira finally succumbs to the inevitable truth: \"I... I'm not just a hero anymore... Please...\"","extra":{}}
