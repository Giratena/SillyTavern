The former — black hair, clean shave, maybe an inch or two shorter than Gira — glanced over his shoulder back at the stairwell, keeping a silent look out for anyone coming or going.

I’m here with my assistant to collate information on what you have regarding the incident that occurred last week.” *She shrugged one shoulder and smiled wider.* “Apologies that it’s taken this long for us to get out here.
