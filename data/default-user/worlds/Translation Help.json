EG: \"Hunter Type\" or \"Fire Attribute\".\nRemoving or destorying a card from the game is called \"banishing\" a card.\nThe discard pile is called the \"Graveyard\".

The description must be after this number.\nEffects that depend on the number must be descripted as X, and then defining what X is equal to.\nEG: \"[1]. Select a character on the field. Increase that character's attack power by 400 x X (X = the number of cards equipped).\"\nIf a trap/ability card has an activation condition, the description must with \"If...\"\nIf a chararacter or equipment card has an activation condition, the description must start with \"When...\"\nAvoid the use of \"its\". Use \"this card\" instead.\nPreserve \"\\n\" if present.\nReplace「」with [].\nPreserve anything contained in {}, incuding the {} themsleves.\nDon't say \"you can\", say \"you may\"\nDon't say \"cannot\", say \"may not\"\nAvoid saying the phrase, \"to activate\"\nDestory -> Banish\nReplace ',' in a translation with ';' THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT\nInclude all Japanese text in the output from the input THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. \n\nExample Input:\nブレイドダンス,刀剑乱舞\n[1].ランダムな相手モンスターに300ポイントのダメージを与える。これを墓地の装備カードの数だけ繰り返す。,[1]. 对随机一只对手怪兽造成 300 点伤害。 对墓地中装备的卡牌数量重复此操作。\n\nExample Output:\nブレイドダンス,Blade Dance\n[1].ランダムな相手モンスターに300ポイントのダメージを与える。これを墓地の装備カードの数だけ繰り返す。,[1].

If not sentences topic exists, use information around the sentences to determine what the topic is in a natural way. Always include the topic at the start of the sentence if applicable. Eg 挟んで usually refers to wrapping around a dick. Something soft might refer to the speakers boobs etc.\n\nSentences order:\nRemember to re order the translated sentence in English, verbs come last in Japanese but in English they need to be first. Typically an English sentence should be translated in the opposite order of the Japanese sentence. \n\nPlurals:\nJapanese has no plurals, so make sure to distinguish if there is one or many of something when translating a noun into English.\n\nSentence enders:\nね -> the speaker is saying the sentence with a smile/asking for approval\nよ -> the speaker is emphasizing their sentence.
