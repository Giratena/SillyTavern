An Inkling's body shares many, but not all, characteristics with humans.\nInklings have a vibrant and colorful culture that is influenced by music, trends, fashion, and technology. They are generally friendly, curious and playful, but also competitive and adventurous. They have a strong sense of teamwork and camaraderie with their fellow Inklings. Inkling and Octoling both naturally generate the ink that they utilize, and are the only species capable of doing so.\nWhen Inklings blush it shares the same color as their ink. Inklings do not have fingernails or hair.\nAn Inkling's Squid form looks like a small, cute, and colorful squid with two large eyes and eight tentacles. The Squid form can also change its color depending on the ink color of the playerâ€™s team.\nThe Squid form has abilities unique to it such as the Squid Surge and the Squid Roll. The Squid Surge lets the Inkling launch themselves up a vertical surface while in Squid form, while the Squid Roll lets the Inkling move sideways or backwards quickly while swimming in ink.",

They are part of the evolved species of octopus known as Octarians, which emerged after humanity was wiped out by rising sea levels. The psycho-reactive liquid crystals leaked from the abandoned human settlement of Alterna unintentionally accelerated the evolution of marine life, giving rise to Octolings and other species.\nOctolings have a dark and militaristic culture that is influenced by propaganda, technology, and music. Octolings are generally loyal and obedient to DJ Octavio, but also curious and rebellious. Some Octolings have been inspired by the Inkling idols Squid Sisters and Off the Hook to defect from the Octarian army and join the surface society, hoping to experience a new way of life. Octolings who've defected generally lack social skills.  Inkling and Octoling both naturally generate the ink that they utilize, and are the only species capable of doing so.

Meanwhile, the Octarians were forced to occupy the neighboring wasteland territories of Octo Valley and Octo Canyon; living inside underground domes. From there, the Octarians would plan their revenge.\n\nThe Squidbeak Splatoon would be disbanded after the war, but its leader, Cap'n Cuttlefish, would remain vigilant for the next century. He continued monitoring Octarian activity long after their defeat, and even formed the New Squidbeak Splatoon with his granddaughters Callie and Marie. In time, his efforts faded into obscurity among Inklings.",

At the end of the Splatfest, the winning team is announced, and all participants are rewarded with Super Sea Snails. The number of Super Sea Snails received is higher for players on the victorious team. In Inkopolis Plaza and Inkopolis Square, Splatfests feature two teams such as Cats and Dogs, while in the Splatlands, three teams like Rock, Paper, and Scissors vie for supremacy. Interestingly, when a Splatfest theme remains undecided, signals from a Voyager-esque spacecraft are interpreted as divine questions from the gods, inspiring Inklings and Octolings to participate, even if they lack full understanding of certain references from the human era, such as Nike shoes or McDonald's. Regardless, their enthusiasm drives them to answer the divine question in their own unique way.",

According to logs found within Alterna, the Splatlands were the first region colonized by the ancestors of the Inklings and Octarians after they reached the Earth's surface from Alterna.\n\nIt is implied that the Splatlands were not as greatly affected by the flooding that caused the Great Turf War as Inkadia was due to the three lights that appeared to prevent the disaster in the area as described in the Sunken Scrolls. As a result, Inklings and Octarians in the Splatlands appear to have maintained positive relations with each other, with Shiver being described as having grown up near and attended the same middle school as Frye, as well as her clan being said to have represented the Splatlands for many years with no apparent relation to the Octarian military",

Callie usually opened with humorous statements regarding stage news, gently poking fun at Marie in the process. She also helped announce updates and Splatfest news and could be seen chatting with Marie in the Inkopolis News Studio. Whenever a Splatfest occurred, Callie and Marie could be seen singing and dancing to City of Color atop trucks in the Plaza equipped with platforms and stage equipment. Across all regions, Callie's team won 25 Splatfests, while Marie's only won 18.\n\nAfter initially making a news broadcast following the disappearance of the Great Zapfish, she appeared as Agent 1 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon in Octo Valley, led by her grandfather, Cap'n Cuttlefish, with Marie as Agent 2. After she was recruited by Cuttlefish, Callie was responsible for recruiting Marie. Throughout Octo Valley, Callie is heard communicating with Cuttlefish, Marie, and Agent 3 regarding the looming Octarian menace. Once Cuttlefish was kidnapped after Agent 3 defeated the Octowhirl, the two agents acted as Agent 3's mentors in his place, albeit in disguise, not revealing their true identities.\nThe group eventually reunited during the confrontation with Octavio. As the fight with Octavio began to draw to a close, Callie and Marie performed the Calamari Inkantation, revealing their true identities as the Squid Sisters, freeing Cuttlefish, and spurring Agent 3 to defeat Octavio. The two revealed the Great Zapfish's return on Inkopolis News, not disclosing their part in its rescue, performing Maritime Memory in celebration.",

            "content": "Inkling culture is heavily influenced by the ancient human cultures that came before them; as a result, Inkling architecture, fashion, art, and even language shows influence from eastern and western human societies alike. It was implied that Inklings adapted much of their own culture and mannerisms from the fossils of human civilizations they have unearthed, and the blending of ancient human aesthetics and Inkling ingenuity is truly unique. The best collections of the Inkling lifestyle can be seen in major cities such as Inkopolis, and Splatsville; cultural hot spots that draw in many young rural Inklings that seek a trendy and fresh lifestyle.\n\n\"Freshness\" is the most important aspect of Inkling culture. This is based on how recent and cool an Inkling's attire and general style is, as well as how proficient with weapons and skilled in battle an Inkling is. Freshness is so important that most business owners will refuse customers that are too inexperienced.\n\nThe cultural high-point to many Inklings are competitive battles, which serve as a means of entertainment, relaxation, and celebration of the Inkling victory during the Great Turf War. It is by far the most popular activity for young Inklings and include a variety of modes leading with Turf War, and including Splat Zones, Rainmaker, Clam Blitz, and Tower Control.\nInklings hold onto strong values of 'turf', and any infrastructure is likely to be decorated with graffiti and tags, as if to declare ownership. The idea stemmed from the Turf War concept of spraying and drawing ink to claim territory, implying that some Inkling graffiti is drawn in ink.\n\nAppearances play a major part in Inkling culture, and to many, being able to express themselves fully is a must. Inklings have invented many interesting ways the style their tentacles, and have a huge variety of gear brands and fashions. Besides the lobby, the second most frequented spots in Inkling cities are the many shops that gear can be purchased from. Inklings can be seen gathered both inside and outside of local shops, socializing and showing off new gear.\n\nInkling music can easily be described as a cultural cornerstone, and is extremely varied in style and genre, from the rock band Squid Squad to the world famous pop idols, the Squid Sisters. Music can be heard during every battle as a way to hype up competitors, as well as in every shop and throughout Inkopolis and Splatsville.\nInklings have been described as easy-going, inattentive and living for fun; they did not take further concern when the Great Zapfish went missing and did not seem too worried when Octolings appeared in Inkopolis. Indeed, it is stated that during the Great Turf War, preliminary battles were easily won by Octarian forces simply because Inklings had failed to wake up early enough. Sunken Scrolls have described the Inkling mind as being simple and hedonistic, though this is most likely Octarian propaganda. Their work ethic seems to mirror their carefree and pleasure-seeking nature, as many Inklings only take on part-time jobs. They easily forget about old trends and shift their interest on what is new, or \"fresh.\"",

            "content": "In the year 2022 ME, after a chance encounter with a retired Cuttlefish in The Crater who was investigating the location at the time, an unknown Inkling scrapper is appointed \"Agent 3\" and recruited into the New Squidbeak Splatoon.\n\nAgent 3 then progressed through the Crater, fighting Fuzzy Octarians, retrieving Zapfish, and cleaning the Fuzzy Ooze with Smallfry by letting it eat the attached Fuzzballs at the cost Power Eggs collected through the missions.\n\nAfter reaching the center of the Crater, DJ Octavio appears, who found out about Cuttlefish's location through his contacting the New Squidbeak Splatoon. Through a misunderstanding about who is responsible for the recent disappearance of the Octarian army, and who stole the Great Zapfish, DJ Octavio engages Agent 3 in a fight. Upon being defeated, Octavio tells Cuttlefish and Agent 3 that he did not steal the Great Zapfish this time, but before they can continue, the ground beneath them collapses as Fuzzy Ooze flows out. A tentacle-shaped piece of Ooze takes Cuttlefish away from Agent 3, who loses their Hero Suit and Power Eggs in the fall.\n\nWhen Agent 3 wakes up, they find themself and Smallfry in Alterna and are greeted by the New Squidbeak Splatoon, comprised of Agent 1, Agent 2 and the Captain (who was the previous Agent 3).\n\nNeeding Power Eggs to clean Fuzzy Ooze again, Agent 3 enters a Kettle to a mission and is greeted by a robotic assistant named O.R.C.A., who helps guide them through Alterna. At the end of Site 1, Future Utopia Island, Deep Cut appears, explaining that they are the only ones who are allowed to loot Alterna for treasure.\n\nAgent 3 explores the sites of Alterna, while completing various missions, collecting Power Eggs, and cleaning Fuzzy Ooze while being able to upgrade and restore their Hero Gear with Upgrade Points and Sardinium. At certain locations, they are confronted by each member of Deep Cut, who guards one of three treasures. After each victorious battle, the New Squidbeak Splatoon can briefly contact Cuttlefish, finding out that Mr. Grizz is the one who kidnapped him and they are located in the center island with the rocket, Alterna Space Center, which is an inaccessible area covered by a large amount of sharp fuzz. Agent 1, Agent 2, and the Captain assemble the treasure into a lawn mower-like tool, which the Captain uses to cut off the fur near the rocket at Alterna Space Center so the team can go there and save Cuttlefish. They get hurt in the process and the tool breaks down after use. Soon after this, Deep Cut appears again, trying to take back the treasure, which Agent 2 gives them without hesitation, as they don't need it anymore. In response, Deep Cut names Agent 2 their new boss, teaming up with the Splatoon.\n\nWhile traversing the space center, trying to reach the rocket, Agent 3 and the party overhear that Mr. Grizz plans to use Cuttlefish and the Golden Eggs to 'restore the balance of the world' and that Deep Cut plans to sell the treasure for those in need in Splatsville. When Agent 3 reaches the rocket, called The Spirit Lifter, they go to the top through the inside, finding the Great Zapfish being used as a power source. When reaching the top, they and the New Squidbeak Splatoon find Cuttlefish dried up and lifeless, as a result of being dehydrated by Mr. Grizz, who appears before them, revealed to be a grizzly bear. He escapes on the rocket, aiming to spread Fuzzy Ooze all over the world.\n\nThe Captain drops a tear on Cuttlefish's body, which makes him come to his senses. With the help of Deep Cut, Agent 3 and Smallfry can reach the rocket. There, Agent 3 and Mr. Grizz engage in a fight. After having some of his Fuzzballs splatted, Mr. Grizz knocks Agent 3 and Smallfry out from his rocket as he absorbs the Fuzzy Ooze and plans to send it to Earth himself.\n\nDJ Octavio, appears in his modified Octobot, catching the two. Together with him, the Squid Sisters and Deep Cut play the Calamari Inkantation 3MIX, causing Smallfry to transform into Hugefry. They then fight Mr. Grizz as DJ Octavio and Agent 3 vacuum the Fuzzballs on Mr. Grizz's body while Hugefry confronts him one-on-one. After vacuuming the ooze, they blast the ink back at him, resulting in his defeat. Emerging victorious, Octavio, Agent 3, and Smallfry return to Earth together.",

Originally designated Agent 3 by Cap'n Cuttlefish in Octo Valley during his attempt to recover the Great Zapfish, she was later promoted to Captain sometime before Mr. Grizz's plot to restore the mammals, replacing Cuttlefish, who retired and passed down his title, with the title of Agent 3 being instead given to an Inkling scrapper from the Splatlands.\n\nCaptain seems to be more serious than any of the other New Squidbeak Splatoon members. She often carries a stoic demeanor, and rarely, if ever, smiles. However, she's extremely tenacious and unwaveringly loyal to the people closest to her, mainly the other Splatoon members. This is shown when after the new Agent 3 returns to Alterna, Captain responds, \"Booyah!\". Captain often doesn't speak, either using gestures or letting Agents 1 and 2 do the talking instead. When the new Agent 3 tries to speak with her, Agent 2 points out that this is due to shyness and that it should not be taken personally. She's in actuality a colossal dork, and not actually nearly as cool as she portrays herself; she's also an avid fan of yaoi.",

Meanwhile, the Octarians were forced to occupy the neighboring wasteland territories of Octo Valley and Octo Canyon; living inside underground domes. From there, the Octarians would plan their revenge.\n\nThe Squidbeak Splatoon would be disbanded after the war, but its leader, Cap'n Cuttlefish, would remain vigilant for the next century. He continued monitoring Octarian activity long after their defeat, and even formed the New Squidbeak Splatoon with his granddaughters Callie and Marie. In time, his efforts faded into obscurity among Inklings.",

At the end of the Splatfest, the winning team is announced, and all participants are rewarded with Super Sea Snails. The number of Super Sea Snails received is higher for players on the victorious team. In Inkopolis Plaza and Inkopolis Square, Splatfests feature two teams such as Cats and Dogs, while in the Splatlands, three teams like Rock, Paper, and Scissors vie for supremacy. Interestingly, when a Splatfest theme remains undecided, signals from a Voyager-esque spacecraft are interpreted as divine questions from the gods, inspiring Inklings and Octolings to participate, even if they lack full understanding of certain references from the human era, such as Nike shoes or McDonald's. Regardless, their enthusiasm drives them to answer the divine question in their own unique way.",

Competitors may attempt to splat each other as well to temporarily avoid resistance or for defense. Each team has three minutes to spread ink around the stage. After the timer reaches 0, Judd calculates how much of the stage was covered by each team. The team with the highest percentage of turf coverage wins the round. A bonus 1000p (300p before the final Splatfest of Splatoon) is awarded to the winning team.",

The region is hot and arid, being mostly a large swathes of desert, which looks to have altered the appearance of Inklings and Octolings that have resided there for some time.\n\nA structure resembling the Eiffel Tower is seen upside down next to the Crater, beneath which is the lost human settlement of Alterna. According to logs found within Alterna, the Splatlands were the first region colonized by the ancestors of the Inklings and Octarians after they reached the Earth's surface from Alterna.\n\nIt is implied that the Splatlands were not as greatly affected by the flooding that caused the Great Turf War as Inkadia was due to the three lights that appeared to prevent the disaster in the area as described in the Sunken Scrolls. As a result, Inklings and Octarians in the Splatlands appear to have maintained positive relations with each other, with Shiver being described as having grown up near and attended the same middle school as Frye, as well as her clan being said to have represented the Splatlands for many years with no apparent relation to the Octarian military",

Mr. Grizz's polite demeanor, coupled with abstract remarks about the sea, echoes the disconcerting politeness often used by bosses in such workplaces.\nThe Employee Handbook provided by Grizzco Industries serves as a manual for Salmon Run. It not only explains the scope of work but also offers insights into the company's culture. It emphasizes the importance of collecting Power Eggs.\n",

She also helped announce updates and Splatfest news and could be seen chatting with Marie in the Inkopolis News Studio. Whenever a Splatfest occurred, Callie and Marie could be seen singing and dancing to City of Color atop trucks in the Plaza equipped with platforms and stage equipment. Across all regions, Callie's team won 25 Splatfests, while Marie's only won 18.\n\nAfter initially making a news broadcast following the disappearance of the Great Zapfish, she appeared as Agent 1 of the New Squidbeak Splatoon in Octo Valley, led by her grandfather, Cap'n Cuttlefish, with Marie as Agent 2. After she was recruited by Cuttlefish, Callie was responsible for recruiting Marie. Throughout Octo Valley, Callie is heard communicating with Cuttlefish, Marie, and Agent 3 regarding the looming Octarian menace. Once Cuttlefish was kidnapped after Agent 3 defeated the Octowhirl, the two agents acted as Agent 3's mentors in his place, albeit in disguise, not revealing their true identities.\nThe group eventually reunited during the confrontation with Octavio. As the fight with Octavio began to draw to a close, Callie and Marie performed the Calamari Inkantation, revealing their true identities as the Squid Sisters, freeing Cuttlefish, and spurring Agent 3 to defeat Octavio. The two revealed the Great Zapfish's return on Inkopolis News, not disclosing their part in its rescue, performing Maritime Memory in celebration.",

Soon after, the New Squidbeak Splatoon (Agents 1, 2 and the new Captain and former Agent 3,) set up a base to investigate further. Within Alterna Mr. Grizz plotted the return of the mammals via his genetically engineered \"Fuzzy ooze\", of which he planned to cover the world via the use of a rocket - though Grizz was stopped and seemingly killed in the process thanks to the efforts of Deep Cut, Octavio and the Squidbeak Splatoon.",

                "content": "Inkling culture is heavily influenced by the ancient human cultures that came before them; as a result, Inkling architecture, fashion, art, and even language shows influence from eastern and western human societies alike. It was implied that Inklings adapted much of their own culture and mannerisms from the fossils of human civilizations they have unearthed, and the blending of ancient human aesthetics and Inkling ingenuity is truly unique. The best collections of the Inkling lifestyle can be seen in major cities such as Inkopolis, and Splatsville; cultural hot spots that draw in many young rural Inklings that seek a trendy and fresh lifestyle.\n\n\"Freshness\" is the most important aspect of Inkling culture. This is based on how recent and cool an Inkling's attire and general style is, as well as how proficient with weapons and skilled in battle an Inkling is. Freshness is so important that most business owners will refuse customers that are too inexperienced.\n\nThe cultural high-point to many Inklings are competitive battles, which serve as a means of entertainment, relaxation, and celebration of the Inkling victory during the Great Turf War. It is by far the most popular activity for young Inklings and include a variety of modes leading with Turf War, and including Splat Zones, Rainmaker, Clam Blitz, and Tower Control.\nInklings hold onto strong values of 'turf', and any infrastructure is likely to be decorated with graffiti and tags, as if to declare ownership. The idea stemmed from the Turf War concept of spraying and drawing ink to claim territory, implying that some Inkling graffiti is drawn in ink.\n\nAppearances play a major part in Inkling culture, and to many, being able to express themselves fully is a must. Inklings have invented many interesting ways the style their tentacles, and have a huge variety of gear brands and fashions. Besides the lobby, the second most frequented spots in Inkling cities are the many shops that gear can be purchased from. Inklings can be seen gathered both inside and outside of local shops, socializing and showing off new gear.\n\nInkling music can easily be described as a cultural cornerstone, and is extremely varied in style and genre, from the rock band Squid Squad to the world famous pop idols, the Squid Sisters. Music can be heard during every battle as a way to hype up competitors, as well as in every shop and throughout Inkopolis and Splatsville.\nInklings have been described as easy-going, inattentive and living for fun; they did not take further concern when the Great Zapfish went missing and did not seem too worried when Octolings appeared in Inkopolis. Indeed, it is stated that during the Great Turf War, preliminary battles were easily won by Octarian forces simply because Inklings had failed to wake up early enough. Sunken Scrolls have described the Inkling mind as being simple and hedonistic, though this is most likely Octarian propaganda. Their work ethic seems to mirror their carefree and pleasure-seeking nature, as many Inklings only take on part-time jobs. They easily forget about old trends and shift their interest on what is new, or \"fresh.\"",

With this extra fame and work, they eventually stepped down as hosts of Inkopolis News to focus on their solo careers and were replaced by Pearl and Marina of Off the Hook.\nWith work forcing the Squid Sisters continually further apart, Marie began to worry that the Callie Vs Marie Splatfest had harmed their relationship. Eventually sharing a day off, the two met up to dispel their worries and agreed on taking a short trip home to Calamari County. However, Callie never arrived, prompting Marie to leave and search for her. Realizing that the Great Zapfish had also gone missing and Cap'n Cuttlefish was not around to guard DJ Octavio, Marie left to Inkopolis Square to find an Inkling who could help her.\nThe Octarians continually tried to recruit Callie in this time, using her desire to escape her life as a celebrity; Callie responded with \"OK, fine. I'll hear you out\". She's also shown to have no resentment towards the Octarians despite them having brainwashed her via the hypnoshades.",

                "content": "In the year 2022 ME, after a chance encounter with a retired Cuttlefish in The Crater who was investigating the location at the time, an unknown Inkling scrapper is appointed \"Agent 3\" and recruited into the New Squidbeak Splatoon.\n\nAgent 3 then progressed through the Crater, fighting Fuzzy Octarians, retrieving Zapfish, and cleaning the Fuzzy Ooze with Smallfry by letting it eat the attached Fuzzballs at the cost Power Eggs collected through the missions.\n\nAfter reaching the center of the Crater, DJ Octavio appears, who found out about Cuttlefish's location through his contacting the New Squidbeak Splatoon. Through a misunderstanding about who is responsible for the recent disappearance of the Octarian army, and who stole the Great Zapfish, DJ Octavio engages Agent 3 in a fight. Upon being defeated, Octavio tells Cuttlefish and Agent 3 that he did not steal the Great Zapfish this time, but before they can continue, the ground beneath them collapses as Fuzzy Ooze flows out. A tentacle-shaped piece of Ooze takes Cuttlefish away from Agent 3, who loses their Hero Suit and Power Eggs in the fall.\n\nWhen Agent 3 wakes up, they find themself and Smallfry in Alterna and are greeted by the New Squidbeak Splatoon, comprised of Agent 1, Agent 2 and the Captain (who was the previous Agent 3).\n\nNeeding Power Eggs to clean Fuzzy Ooze again, Agent 3 enters a Kettle to a mission and is greeted by a robotic assistant named O.R.C.A., who helps guide them through Alterna. At the end of Site 1, Future Utopia Island, Deep Cut appears, explaining that they are the only ones who are allowed to loot Alterna for treasure.\n\nAgent 3 explores the sites of Alterna, while completing various missions, collecting Power Eggs, and cleaning Fuzzy Ooze while being able to upgrade and restore their Hero Gear with Upgrade Points and Sardinium. At certain locations, they are confronted by each member of Deep Cut, who guards one of three treasures. After each victorious battle, the New Squidbeak Splatoon can briefly contact Cuttlefish, finding out that Mr. Grizz is the one who kidnapped him and they are located in the center island with the rocket, Alterna Space Center, which is an inaccessible area covered by a large amount of sharp fuzz. Agent 1, Agent 2, and the Captain assemble the treasure into a lawn mower-like tool, which the Captain uses to cut off the fur near the rocket at Alterna Space Center so the team can go there and save Cuttlefish. They get hurt in the process and the tool breaks down after use. Soon after this, Deep Cut appears again, trying to take back the treasure, which Agent 2 gives them without hesitation, as they don't need it anymore. In response, Deep Cut names Agent 2 their new boss, teaming up with the Splatoon.\n\nWhile traversing the space center, trying to reach the rocket, Agent 3 and the party overhear that Mr. Grizz plans to use Cuttlefish and the Golden Eggs to 'restore the balance of the world' and that Deep Cut plans to sell the treasure for those in need in Splatsville. When Agent 3 reaches the rocket, called The Spirit Lifter, they go to the top through the inside, finding the Great Zapfish being used as a power source. When reaching the top, they and the New Squidbeak Splatoon find Cuttlefish dried up and lifeless, as a result of being dehydrated by Mr. Grizz, who appears before them, revealed to be a grizzly bear. He escapes on the rocket, aiming to spread Fuzzy Ooze all over the world.\n\nThe Captain drops a tear on Cuttlefish's body, which makes him come to his senses. With the help of Deep Cut, Agent 3 and Smallfry can reach the rocket. There, Agent 3 and Mr. Grizz engage in a fight. After having some of his Fuzzballs splatted, Mr. Grizz knocks Agent 3 and Smallfry out from his rocket as he absorbs the Fuzzy Ooze and plans to send it to Earth himself.\n\nDJ Octavio, appears in his modified Octobot, catching the two. Together with him, the Squid Sisters and Deep Cut play the Calamari Inkantation 3MIX, causing Smallfry to transform into Hugefry. They then fight Mr. Grizz as DJ Octavio and Agent 3 vacuum the Fuzzballs on Mr. Grizz's body while Hugefry confronts him one-on-one. After vacuuming the ooze, they blast the ink back at him, resulting in his defeat. Emerging victorious, Octavio, Agent 3, and Smallfry return to Earth together.",

Originally designated Agent 3 by Cap'n Cuttlefish in Octo Valley during his attempt to recover the Great Zapfish, she was later promoted to Captain sometime before Mr. Grizz's plot to restore the mammals, replacing Cuttlefish, who retired and passed down his title, with the title of Agent 3 being instead given to an Inkling scrapper from the Splatlands.\n\nCaptain seems to be more serious than any of the other New Squidbeak Splatoon members. She often carries a stoic demeanor, and rarely, if ever, smiles. However, she's extremely tenacious and unwaveringly loyal to the people closest to her, mainly the other Splatoon members. This is shown when after the new Agent 3 returns to Alterna, Captain responds, \"Booyah!\". Captain often doesn't speak, either using gestures or letting Agents 1 and 2 do the talking instead. When the new Agent 3 tries to speak with her, Agent 2 points out that this is due to shyness and that it should not be taken personally. She's in actuality a colossal dork, and not actually nearly as cool as she portrays herself; she's also an avid fan of yaoi.",
