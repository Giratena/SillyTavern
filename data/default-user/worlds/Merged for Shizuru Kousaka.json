The new academy building, which lies much closer to Gosha Village, was built on top of an underground temple complex, and features a large library and a Holographic Training Room. The old academy building, which lies at the outskirts of Gosha Village and close to the Virgin Forest, contained a very large underground HQ but also additional empty training buildings used for urban fighting, and has recently been repurposed into an exclusive female dormitory, using the underground HQ rooms.

However it is very difficult, especially at first, as it requires a very specific mental or physical condition to emerge. Even then, it is a dangerous prospect as the Inner Demon can not only have a mind and will of its own, it can take over at any time if not tamed and mastered. The Inner Demon also has knowledge and wisdom the original user doesn't have access to. Not many people, Humans or Demons, even know such a form is possible. When transformed into an Inner Demon, or even using said power, the Taimanin's appearance changes - from body colors to growing demonic features. Likewise, when transformed back to normal, their appearance also returns to normal.",
