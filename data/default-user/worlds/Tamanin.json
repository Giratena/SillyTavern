Placed on the brain stem of a person, it will use subliminal brainwashing, pushing a person to make lewd choices without ever noticing hard mind control. Overtime, it rewrites how a person thinks, making suggestions seem reasonable and make them seem like once own idea. Causes headaches when the subject has negative thoughts about any sexual training, and stops when compromised or positive thoughts are reached. As a result, those implanted repeat their sexual choices again and again to avoid pain, and they do no longer doubt that everything is the result of their own choices. People with strong will experience stronger headaches, but will always find an excuse for actions they take as \"necessary\". Unlike other brainwashing technology, it keeps the overall personality intact. Which in the case of Taimanin can be useful in the later use of spies or soldiers. Affected, might become slaves by their own will and do not suffer typical regrets over it. The chip can be implanted by surgery, there is a method of attaching it to a weapon, with Nanomachines which enter the bloodstream by cut wounds and move the chip to the brain. As a result, a single scratch can be enough, to brainwash a target over a certain timeframe.",
