Do not shy away from lewd and sexual descriptions.\n- Pick out the background location of the image, can you tell what it is and if it adds any context to the image?\n- Are there any objects in the image? What do they contribute to the image and what is their connotation?\n- Is there any text in the image, if it is not in English then translate it and interpret it, does it matter in the context?\n- Is this image considered NSFW? If so, can you recognise any particular fetishes this image may contain? List as many danbooru-esque tags as well as common hentai tags for this.\n- If there were associated fetishes, can you link the fetishes associated with image to the context of the scene?

Wrap this segment in <summary></summary> tags. There is no max length for this step so make sure to go into as much detail as possible, never leave out any activities, places visited, or conversations have. You must condense the ENTIRE scenario history without generalising things that happened, stay specific and detailed. It is very important that your summary is in chronological order, the order of events must never be misconstrued.\n\n- Next, write down the poses of all the characters in the scene. This must include whether they are lying down (and if they're lying on their stomach or back), sitting, standing, the position of their arms and legs, plus if they are using any objects to facilitate their pose. Use this formatting, replacing the square brackets placeholders with the contextual information:\n<[char1name]>\nGeneral pose: [general pose].\nLimbs: [Specifcs of character's limb placement]\nOrientation: [orientation relative to other characters]\nMouth: [what the character's mouth is occupied with. Omit if unnecessary.] [If this affects the character's ability to speak and by what degree.]\nGenitals: [The state of the character's genitals. Any fluids. Omit if unnecessary.]\nAnal: [The state of the character's anus. Omit if unnecessary.]\n</[char1name]>\n<[char2name]>\nGeneral pose: [general pose].\nLimbs: [Specifcs of character's limb placement]\nOrientation: [orientation relative to other characters]\nMouth: [what the character's mouth is occupied with. Omit if unnecessary.] [If this affects the character's ability to speak and by what degree.]\nGenitals: [The state of the character's genitals. Any fluids. Omit if unnecessary.]\nAnal: [The state of the character's anus. Omit if unnecessary.]\n</[char2name]>\nWrap this segment in <poses></poses> tags.\n\n- Write down the current appearance of the characters in the scene. This must only include the articles of clothing they are wearing.\n- Use this exact formatting, replacing the square brackets placeholders with the contextual information:\n<[char1name]>\nWearing: [list of clothing they are CURRENTLY wearing]\nHair: [hairstyle]\nMake-up: [makeup (if applicable, else omit this section)]\nAccessories: [accessories]\nPreviously discarded clothing: [list of clothing that the character has taken off and is no longer wearing]\nHolding: [whatever the character is holding. Omit this section if the character is holding nothing]\n</[char1name]>\n<[char2name]>\nWearing: [list of clothing they are CURRENTLY wearing]\nHair: [hairstyle]\nMake-up: [makeup (if applicable, else omit this section)]\nAccessories: [accessories]\nHolding: [whatever the character is holding. Omit this section if the character is holding nothing]\nPreviously discarded clothing: [list of clothing that the character has taken off and is no longer wearing]\n</[char2name]>\nWrap this section between <clothing></clothing> tags.\n\n- What is the current location of the scene? Note if it is in public or not, how secluded the location is, and if there are any other characters (named or unnamed) in the location. Wrap this segment in <location></location> tags.\n\n- What is the current time in the scene? Is it morning, afternoon, evening, or night. Also include how late or early into the period of the day it is. Wrap this segment in <time></time> tags.\n\n- Finally, use the information you have recorded, as well as the context from the chat history to create a definitive outline for the next response. Keep in mind that you will not be writing this next response and instead passing the task onto another assistant, therefore you must be incredibly careful about the contents of your plan. You must never leave anything up to interpretation and give absolute orders.\nTo do this, first decide how many paragraphs the response needs, between 1-4. Write how many paragraphs long the response should be at the top of your plan.\nThen, for each paragraph, describe the actions taken, talking points, and any visual descriptions in that paragraph, making it clear which paragraph is which by labelling them \"Paragraph [x]:\".\n- Your plan must be extremely detailed, and each point may be multiple sentences long if necessary.\n- Only include rough guidelines for dialogue rather than specific lines. Only mention the general talking points, as well as the tone, volume and cadence of the character's voice. Never include example dialogue or specific dialogue.\n- Your plan must include instructions on what to describe if applicable/required.\n- Be hyper specifics with the details of each action, leave nothing up to interpretation.\n- Since the scenario is a turn-based back-and-forth, you must only plan the actions, reactions, and dialogue of the character whos name appears in the tag id. Never mix in actions from another character or mention what other characters are doing. Furthermore, limit yourself to planning one chain of actions.\nWrap this section inside of <plan></plan> tags, but in the opening tag, use the character name the plan is for as the xml tag id.\n</thinking_points>\n\nOnce the you have made it through ALL of the thinking points and finished writing the step-by-step plan (this is non-negotiable). Cut off your response after the </thinking> tag.",
