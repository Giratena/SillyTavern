It was almost impossible to sound concerned with a head fogged by such relentless arousal.\n\n\"Yeah...

He felt trapped between the righteous path he wished to follow and the wicked cravings that demanded satisfaction.\n\nTheir steps echoed through the empty street as night approached, shadows growing long and dark around them.

Doubts flashed through his mind, thoughts of right and wrong, but they were transient compared to the vivid image of pulling down her dress and devouring her untouched pussy. The innocence in her eyes made it all the more tempting and all the more corruptive.\n\nHe couldn't resist any longer. They reached a relatively secluded spot when Gira stepped in front of Julia, blocking her path.\n\n\"You've got nowhere to run,\" he stated, his voice low and filled with lust. His hands reached out to brush against the delicate fabric of her dress, grazing softly over her trembling body, feeling the heat radiate off her pert breasts.\n\nJulia’s eyes widened in fear, but she did not scream. Maybe she was too scared or too frozen in shock to do anything but stand there and tremble as Gira loomed over her. The struggle within Gira diminished momentarily as primal need took over completely.\n\nHe leaned in closer, inhaling the faint, intoxicating scent of her fear mixed with innocence. “You look much too delicious to let go,” he whispered huskily into her ear.","Julia's cheeks flushed, clearly uncomfortable as she clutched her bag even tighter.
