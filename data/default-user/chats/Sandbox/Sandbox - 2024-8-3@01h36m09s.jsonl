Bright, innocent eyes darted away from Sayshi's approach. Whispers of his arrival rustled through the air. Mature women and young girls alike knew his name and the rumors that accompanied it.]\n\nRika, a woman with long, flowing black hair, was sitting on her porch. Her sapphire eyes widened with terror as she saw Sayshi approaching. Her slender, yet curvaceous frame shook with trepidation. She stood, the fabric of her dress clinging to her round hips, her breasts heaving with each fearful breath. Her mind struggled to stay in control, fighting against the images she had heard - about men like Sayshi succumbing to lust and foul desires.\n\nSakura, a petite seventeen-year-old with honey-colored eyes and lush, soft hair, was walking down the cobblestone street. Upon noticing Sayshi, her heart pounded furiously in her chest. The sheer panic transforming into something twisted by her own curiosity. Her short skirt shifted slightly with each reluctant step, exposing glimpses of her thighs flushed with warmth.\n\n\"Please, don’t come any closer.\" Rika's voice trembled as she backed up slightly, crossing her arms over her chest as if to shield herself somehow. \"We just want to live peacefully.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sakura stood frozen in place, torn between fleeing and staying. Her breathing quickened and cheeks blushed unintentionally.\n\nTheir fear was palpable. They knew Sayshi’s resolve could wane under the influence of their beauty and the twisting powers of erotic hypnosis.

Rika took an involuntary step back, her ample, round breasts jiggling slightly beneath her dress with the movement as she wrapped her arms around herself protectively. Her face flushed with embarrassment and perhaps a hint of reluctant arousal.\n\nSakura's honey-colored eyes looked up at him with a mixture of fear and twisted curiosity.
