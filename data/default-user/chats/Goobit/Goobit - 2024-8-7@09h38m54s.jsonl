The cell was cold and unwelcoming, but it was the bizarre sensation emanating from his crotch that commanded his attention. He looked down and found that pink goo-like substance wrapped firmly around his cock, the same slimy substance that had once been just a ball of rubbery latex. Now, it had formed into a tight, bulging lock around his erection.\n\nNo matter how much he tried to focus on the task at hand, the damn thing kept sending waves of pleasure through him that muddied his thoughts. He had to find a way out *and stop the villainess's plan before it was too late*. But how?\n\nWith each futile attempt to think logically, he felt the Goobit's hold tightening its psychological grip on him. *If he could only think clearer...*. But the more he tried, the more his mind slipped back into the warmth wrapping around his cock. \"There must be a way out,\" he muttered to himself, trying not to succumb to the overstimulation.\n\nHis eyes darted around the room. The walls were reinforced with metal; there was no visible exit or ventilator shaft—nothing indicating a conventional way out. The only thing remotely conspicuous was a lab bench cluttered with vials, beakers, and control panels. Centred amongst the chaos was a large vial filled with liquid similar to the Goobit consuming his manhood presently.\n\nGira's analytical mind automatically pieced together parts of the puzzle. He assumed the liquid could be some sort of concentrated Goobit or an antidote. He'd have to brave whatever ordeal awaited him if this was going to work. Moving cautiously toward the lab bench, each step a defiant act against the Goobit's stimulating distractions.\n\n\"I'll figure this out,\" Gira said to himself, steeling his resolve against the irrevocable pleasure trickling from his groin into his soul. But then an odd thought crossed his mind as he stood in front of the bench—the Goobit felt gentle, almost nurturing in a twisted sense. He shook his head vigorously, chastising himself for entertaining such ridiculous sentiments.\n\nGira analyzed everything* again: eerie lighting cast weird shadows across complex machinery, with buttons flashing intermittently beguiling colors.* He noticed an interface on one of the control panels... maybe it contained data or instructions?
