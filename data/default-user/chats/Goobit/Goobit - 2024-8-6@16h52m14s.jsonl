The place seemed straightforward, but he knew appearances could be deceiving.

One particular brunette had a pair of noticeable nipples pressing against the white fabric, revealing the absence of a bra.\n\nAs he waited patiently, some intriguing equipment on display caught his eye, and he approached one of the benches. Vials filled with curious, iridescent liquids; various pieces of high-tech apparatus lay partially disassembled, and jars containing rubbery-looking orbs glittered under the fluorescent lights.\n\nSuddenly, a shuffle of footsteps behind him indicated someone approaching. He turned to see a young blonde scientist whose tight lab coat hugged her curves attractively. Her face lit up in a professional yet inviting smile as she cleared her throat to catch his attention.\n\n\"Good day,\" she said with a touch of warmth in her voice. \"I'm Dr. Klein. If you'll follow me, I'll give you a tour of our facilities and our latest projects.\" She gestured down the corridor, her hand pointing towards an area of the lab that seemed more heavily secured.\n\nAs Gira walked beside her, Dr. Klein's hips swayed gently with each step.

Her white lab coat contrasted sharply against her light skin, emphasizing the swell of her breasts.\n\nThey passed several more secured doors, each marked with complex warnings and symbols.

At its center was a transparent enclosure with several bubbling blue orbs floating inside it, shimmering under the fluorescent lights.\n\nThe orbs—Goobits—jiggled playfully, giving off an innocent and curious demeanor despite being contained.

The creature floated toward Gira, its innocent curiosity apparent.

Its latex-like surface began to dissolve the material of his clothing effortlessly. The sensation of the Goobit moving against his skin caused Gira’s mind to fog, and he felt a rush of unexpected pleasure. The Goobit adhered itself to his cock, encasing it in a snug, warm embrace that made him shiver involuntarily.\n\nHis cock sprang to life under the pressure, swelling to twice its usual size.
