He could feel a strange connection forming between them, drawing the latex-like substance closer to his body.\n\n\"Damn,\" Gira muttered, feeling a sudden rush of arousal. \"What the hell is this thing doing?\"\n\nA soft chuckle drew his attention to one of the female scientists nearby. Her lab coat barely concealed her tight blouse, buttons straining against her large breasts, nipples faintly visible through the thin fabric. Her pencil skirt hugged her hips and ass, each step she took making it ride up slightly, exposing more of her creamy thighs.\n\n\"Be careful with that!\" she warned, not noticing Gira's current aroused state. \"We don't fully understand these creatures yet.\"\n\nGira gave a slight nod, but his focus was divided.
