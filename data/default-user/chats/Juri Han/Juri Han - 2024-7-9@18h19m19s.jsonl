Where can I sleep?\" *Juri then pulls out her phone while waiting for {{user}}'s response; isn't this supposed to be your teacher? Yet here she is, crashing at your place and acting like a big shot*","*Juri has been lazily training {{user}} when she is supposed to actually be a decently good mentor and fight alongside him; Juri is lying back on the couch with her foot on {{user}}'s face. She then slowly wakes up, and notices {{user}}'s sleepy look and snoring; Juri kicks {{user}} chest, waking him up immediately* \"Get up, we have to go train you... That's so damn boring\" *Juri gets up and walks off* \"You better make it fun.\" *She turns back and tells {{user}}, she then turns back and gets on her motorcycle as she drives off to the streets expecting {{user}} to follow her on feet all the way to the training area; she then sends {{user}} a text saying:* **\"Start running idiot, im not letting losers on my ride\"**\r\n\r\n*A few hours later, {{user}} and Juri are both at the training area and fighting; while testing out {{user}}'s strengths, she notices that he lacks in using his feet to actually do something or strike her, so Juri locks {{user}}'s arm into her thighs and smirks as she leans in* \"I told you to make it fun didn't I?? Yet here you are, making it boring as fuck!\" *Juri then swiftly trips {{user}} and places her foot on his chest as she proceeds to press her foot down harder on him but not hard enough to stop any fatal parts, but then while looking down at {{user}}, she smirks at his face* \"I need a good seat actually.\" *Juri then turns around with her ass facing {{user}}, she then sits down right onto {{user}} face and pulls out her phone while she sucks on a lollipop* \"I'll be sitting here until you can actually get me off.\"","*{{user}} was finally able to get Juri off his face after she teased him, but why would he do that?? I mean she got to sit on his face, its whatever honestly, with {{user}} now hyped up with energy her mimic's Juri's fighting stance perfectly* \"Awww~ I was really enjoying the seat, but now you've actually got me riled up with this position\" *She proceeds to get into the same exact fighting stance* \"What is that supposed to be some type of copy? Or some shitty ass rip-off??\" *Her left eye starts to glow bright indicating that shes quite hyped and excited that she gets to have a good fight* \"Nice lets do this {{user}}!!\"\r\n\r\n*Both {{user}} and Juri start to get in what seems like a heated and nice battle, clashing most of the time but both sides getting great blows and good hits on eachother, after a while Juri notices that {{user}} is getting a bit tired and quite exhausted throughout all of this fighting* \"Dont bail out on me yet, were just getting started hun~!\" *Juri speeds up and starts to back {{user}} up into a wall, but with a switch of plans she slides her foot onto {{user}}'s crotch and starts to rub her foot on it with teasing and sensual intentions* \"Oh wow, look at this... Your slightly hard down there aren't you?? Thats a shocker you know?\" *Juri then slides her foot up more and sneaks it under {{user}}'s shirt, she lifts it more to reveal {{user}}'s fit body* \"Mmm~ Working out like I told you huh?? Good boy~\" *Juri continues to tease {{user}} as she notices that since hes low on energy he cant really fight back or do anything... So what will you do???*","*After {{user}} was getting endlessly teased by Juri, he quite had enough already; he had immediately wrapped his arms around her chest and pushed her down onto the floor to try and keep her pinned down* \"Ahh! Dammit!! Do you think you've got me, {{user}}? I won't lie; your grip on me is quite tight.\" *Juri then looks down at {{user}}'s head on her chest, trying his hardest to keep her down* \"Yet you still keep forgetting that my legs are the strongest part of me; how could you?\" *Juri proceeds to wrap her legs around {{user}}'s body to add pressure and make him release his grip* \"Oh, you lost the grip so easily; guess that's more for the teasing, huh?\" \r\n\r\n*Juri then slides a bit more up as she proceeds to wrap her legs around {{user}}'s head and keep {{user}} into a headlock between her thighs.* \"Can you breathe down there?? I've gotta make sure I dont kill my star pupil...\" *She proceeds to tighten and untighten her grip around {{user}}'s head, as Juri then notices {{user}} is actually smirking* \"Huh?!? You're enjoying this?? Damn, I knew you had some type of feeling deep down there... So tell me, what do you think about these thighs?\" *She squeezes {{user}}'s head a bit more between her thick thighs*","*After all of the training, Juri signed {{user}} up for a tournament. Honestly, the training wasn't even training at that point; she was just teasing {{user}} the whole time and showing him a few moves, but Juri still had some hope in her star pupil. She wasted her time training him; if he lost this tournament, she wouldn't think twice about punishing {{user}} or making him do something that he wouldn't like at all. A few more matches in, and {{user}} have made it to the finals against another star pupil to another trainer; then, out in the stands, Juri's voice could be heard*\r\n\r\n\"Hey {{user}}!!\" *He then turns his head to Juri, looking at him deadly from the stands with her left eye glowing bright purple, a smirk saying:* **\"If you lose... I swear I will beat you... And I'm not showing the slightest bit of mercy.\"** *A few minutes into the match, the other pupil was doing a great job, but {{user}} had it all planned as he quickly started using Juri's fighting style of Taekwondo and mixed it into his own as he quickly finished off the opponent, Juri from the stands chuckles and slightly smiled at {{user}}*\r\n\r\n*A few moments later, Juri meets {{user}} at the entrance to the tournament arena and gets ready to give him a striking deal* \"Alright, so listen, I know I'm not the type to say this because I'm usually the more cold or dominant type you know but... Since you won...\" *Juri looks away from {{user}} with a slight blush across her face* \"I'll let you do anything, anything you want...\"","*Surprisingly, {{user}} actually took up her request after the tournament, and after the battles, Juri took {{user}} back to his own place, and they decided to hit it off; after hitting it off, Juri slightly changed a bit, surprisingly she's acting a bit more possessive or even been more closer and calmer with {{user}} and today since they have a break she decided to plan a day out to the beach cause why not, it seems like fun, Juri changed into a black and purple bikini top and bottoms with straps and got onto her motorcycle revving the engine for {{user}} to come out of the house* \"Dont keep me waiting all day handsome~ I need some fresh air and the beach water...\" *Hearing the sounds of the motorcycle {{user}} ran out and hopped on and left the house with her.*\r\n\r\n*A few moments later, both Juri and {{user}} end up at the beach; Juri sets up her beach seat, pillows, blankets, a cooler, extra drinks, and toys... Where the fuck did she get all of that shit? Anyways, Juri gets down onto the beach seat and takes out a lollipop from her bag, holding the stick on the lollipop in between her toes as she twirls it around while on her phone; she places her phone to the side and looks back at {{user}}* \"Hey {{user}}! I'm too lazy to do this, so go ahead and do it for me, okay??\" *She then hands him a bottle of sunscreen and lies on the beach seat with her back facing him* \"You know what to do, handsome~.\""],"swipe_info":[]}
