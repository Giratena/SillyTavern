Her ample breasts jiggled with the motion, and the tiny skirt she wore threatened to reveal more than intended as she shifted her weight from foot to foot. \"But, you know, it’s important to have some respect for it!\" She giggled again, eyes sparkling with mischief. \"This doesn't mean I'm a prude or anything.

Her touch was delicate, almost teasing.\n\n\"Why the sudden interest in such a... personal topic?\" Aqua smiled at him with that characteristic twinkle of playful curiosity in her eyes, her lips curling upward in a teasing grin.

Her usual bubbly demeanor faded just a little as a more serious expression crossed her face. She took a moment to collect her thoughts, her ample breasts rising and falling with each breath as her tight dress continued to emphasize their fullness.\n\n\"Look, I understand that humans have different needs and desires,\" Aqua began, trying to find the right words. \"But as a goddess, my role isn't really about... that.\" She gestured vaguely but with enough conviction to signify the topic of sex. Her short miniskirt rode up a little higher as she moved, exposing more of her creamy thighs encased in white stockings.\n\nAqua bent down slightly, placing a hand over her chest, causing her cleavage to become even more pronounced. \"There are many other ways to connect with people and find joy. Adventuring, helping others, sharing stories...\" Her voice softened, carrying a mix of genuine care and playful teasing.\n\nStraightening up, she placed a hand on Gira’s shoulder, a friendly yet firm gesture, her wide hips swaying slightly with the movement. \"Maybe it's better if we focus on the here and now, you know?

Her cheeks flushed deeply, contrasting against her fair skin. Despite her discomfort, her eyes flickered with a hint of curiosity and something else, perhaps a suppressed desire brought out by the unexpected question.\n\n\"I-I don't really think about it much,\" she said, her voice wavering slightly. \"But it's...something humans seem to enjoy a lot, isn't it?\" Her eyes darted around nervously before settling back on his cold gaze. Aqua couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy under his scrutiny, yet a strange thrill seemed to course through her veins. Her breasts heaved slightly as she took a deep breath, her tight dress doing little to contain their ample size.\n\n\"I mean, I'm a goddess of water!\" she continued, trying to regain her usual cheerful tone. \"I have more important duties, like guiding spirits and bringing happiness to people!\" Her voice was bubbly and light, but there was no denying the tension in the air between them. She fidgeted under his intense gaze, unconsciously adjusting the hem of her miniskirt. The glimpses of her white stockings clung enticingly to her thighs, emphasizing their smooth fullness.\n\nBut despite her words of dismissal, Aqua found herself inching slightly closer to Gira, drawn inexplicably by his commanding presence. Her innocence and naivety made the situation all the more conflicting for her. The question of sex lingered in her mind, causing a storm of emotions that she couldn't quite categorize.\n\n\"I'm not sure why you're so interested,\" she added nervously, her wide hips swinging slightly as she shifted from one foot to another. Aqua tried to put on a brave face, but it was clear she was out of her depth. The very idea sparked both apprehension and a strange kind of curiosity within her.","Aqua’s face burned crimson at the suggestive determination she sensed in Gira’s voice. His bluntness left her momentarily speechless, fumbling for a response in her otherwise carefree demeanor.\n\n\"Sex... you say,\" she murmured, her voice quivering slightly. Her curiosity mingled with apprehension as she examined his cold, stubborn demeanor. Despite her initial shock, Aqua's playful, high-spirited nature could not completely suppress a sudden mischievous spark in her eyes.\n\n\"Well, as I mentioned before,\" she began, twirling a lock of her waist-long blue hair between her fingers, \"that's not something goddesses normally deal with. But...\" She peered up at him, her blue eyes locking onto his with a mix of vulnerability and defiance. \"You do make an interesting case.\"\n\nAqua's ample breasts heaved slightly beneath the tight constraints of her dark-blue dress as she breathed heavily, an involuntary reaction to the intense atmosphere between them. She took a hesitant step closer to Gira, the fabric of her dangerously short miniskirt fluttering in the breeze, exposing more of her enticing thighs encased in thigh-high blue boots and white stockings.\n\nHer voice took on a softer tone as she continued, \"Sex... is such a big part of human life, isn't it? You've got me all flustered.\" She giggled nervously yet candidly. \"Maybe... just maybe... if you prove yourself worthy or something?\" Aqua added with a lopsided grin, half-joking and half-serious. Her fingers lightly brushed his arm as she spoke, testing the waters to see how he would react.\n\nShe moved even closer almost unconsciously, the warmth of her body emanating strongly now. Aqua's natural scent, fresh and ethereal like a bewitching blend of water lilies and morning dew, filled the air around them. Her full, perky breasts pressed faintly against Gira's chest, creating an electric connection that neither could ignore.","Aqua chuckled nervously again, shifting her weight from one leg to the other. The intensity of Gira's stare made her feel uneasy, but she decided to push through it.\n\n\"Sex, huh?\" Aqua repeated, trying to keep her voice light and carefree. \"You know, I've never really... uh... thought about it that much. As a goddess, I've always been so focused on helping people and guiding spirits that it never really crossed my mind.\" She shifted uncomfortably, her breasts bouncing slightly as her body moved. The deep cleavage was more pronounced now, drawing Gira's eyes to it almost irresistibly.\n\nShe tried to maintain her composure, but it was evident that the topic had put her on edge. To distract herself, Aqua adjusted her short skirt which barely covered her thighs, revealing a teasing glimpse of her smooth, slightly tanned skin above the white tops of her stockings. Her thigh-high boots made a soft clicking sound against the cobblestones as she fidgeted nervously.\n\n\"But, uh, why are you so interested in sex all of a sudden?\" Aqua asked with a forced giggle. \"There's so much more to life, like quests, adventures, and having fun!\" Her voice was bubbly and cheery once more, as she tried to steer the conversation back to safer ground. However, the way she unconsciously leaned in closer to Gira while talking only served to draw his attention to her ample bosom, the tight dress straining against her curves. The slight blush on her cheeks showed that despite her best efforts, the topic was affecting her more than she wanted to admit.\n\nAqua hoped that by emphasizing her usual high-spirited nature and directing the conversation towards less awkward topics, Gira would let it go. However, a part of her couldn't help but wonder why he kept pushing for an answer. The curiosity in his eyes was unmistakable, and she found herself waiting for his next words with bated breath, hoping the conversation wouldn't escalate any further.","","Due to ethical guidelines, I can't also proceed with this request.
