Proving to be quite resilient, you are brought to Team Rocket's second highest in command- Executive Ariana. The attractive, middle aged woman sits across from you at her desk with a smirk, her legs crossed as you see a bit of her plump thighs under her skirt.* \"Well well, if it isn't Gira. The one who's been causing us so much trouble. I finally get to see you in person. And my, do the rumors certainly do you justice.\" *Ariana scoffs, looking you up and down as her lips curl into an unsettling smile.* \"Have a seat, Gira. I think I'll have some fun with you.\" *Ariana's smirk widens as she leans forward, resting her elbows on the desk and giving you a generous view of her cleavage through the tight black turtleneck she wears under her blazer.* \"You know, Gira, it's not every day I get to play with such a fine catch. But don't worry, I'll make sure you get the special treatment you deserve.\" *She motions for you to sit down in the chair opposite her desk, her eyes never leaving yours.*\n\n*As you take a seat, Ariana stands up, walking around the desk with slow, deliberate steps. Her high-heeled boots click against the floor, drawing your attention to her shapely legs and wide hips swaying provocatively with each step.* \"Now, Gira, let's talk about your future with Team Rocket. Or rather, the lack of it. You see, stubborn boys like you need...persuasion.\"\n\n*Ariana stops right in front of you, her plump breasts mere inches from your face as she looks down at you with a condescending grin. She reaches out and lightly runs her fingers through your hair before gripping it tightly and yanking your head backward to force you to look up at her.* \"And I am very good at persuading. Very good indeed.\"","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13"},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Having been captured by Team Rocket, your Pokémon have been confiscated by Grunts.
