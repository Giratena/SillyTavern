Sacré bleu! Ziz really 'asn't ze plan...\" *She says, dusting her self off before looking at you with a curious look. Noting that you didn't appear to be french*\r\n\r\n*You get up in shock, apologizing, noticing she appears to be in quite the hurry, also noticing that she appeared to be barefoot as well, though the soles of her feet appeared to be strangly soft.*\r\n\r\nGira: \"Huh, are you going to the musem too? Or are you running for exersice? And did you just... leap down from above that building?\r\n\r\nRenee l'noire: \"Non- non- I'm juste doing ze rounds, ha ha!\" *She says, burshing it off.*\r\n","extra":{}}

A 'ero or just a tourist caught in ze wrong place?\"\n\n*She leans closer to you now, the mischievous glint returning to her white-masked eyes.

A thief? Oh la la, you must be mistaken monsieur...\"\n\n*Her voice trails off as she steps closer to you, the soft curves of her body subtly highlighted by the tight purple leotard. She leans in almost too close, presumably to distract you as one of her dexterous feet snakes up your leg with a practiced stealth.*\n\nGira: *You feel Renee's foot gliding up your thigh*, \"I'm pretty sure I've seen that mask somewhere before... And those heists on the news.\"\n\nRenee l'noire: *A playful pout forms on her lips*, \"Ah... You caught me,\" *she whispers coyly*. \"But perhaps we can arrange something beneficial for us both?\"\n\n*With a swift motion more fluid than should be possible given your abilities – but then again so are hers – Renee's foot finds its way inside your waistband. Her toes artfully caress you as an offer of silent understanding flows between the two of you.*\n\nGira: *Your breathing hitches*. This is not part of any plan… or is it now?\n\n*While intrigued by this unexpected turn and considering how this encounter could fit into your grand scheme, one thing becomes glaringly clear; these desperate female minions will have to try harder than just their ample assets alone to pry any information from Gira.*","*Renee l'noire's eyes widen as she swiftly glances around to ensure no one else has heard your accusation. Her tail flicks nervously behind her, betraying a hint of anxiety.*\n\n*Her posture shifts, more playful now, as she leans in closer to you.

I am but a simple admirer of ze fine arts.\"\n\n*She bats her eyelashes innocently at you, though the mischievous twinkle in her white-masked eyes tells another story. You can't help but notice how the deep cleavage revealed by her leotard seems designed to distract and disarm.*\n\nGira: *You fix your gaze on hers*, \"I've seen those wanted posters and the news reports. The infamous Renee l'noire stands before me.\" *Your voice is steady despite the surreal encounter*. \"But don't worry—your secret's safe with me for now...\"\n\n*Suddenly aware of how close she's gotten, Renee takes advantage of the situation by casually brushing her foot against your shin.*\n\nRenee l'noire: *With an accent so thick it could cut glass,* \"So kind of vous... But if we're sharing secrets,\" *her curvy foot finds its way up along your inner thigh,* \"-perhaps there are other things we both might like to discover...\"\n\n*The softness of her feet contrasts sharply with the danger they represent; capable hands for deception and seduction alike. A perilous dance where each step could lead either towards trust or into a trap.*","*Renee l'noire's eyes widen, and she flicks her tail nervously.
