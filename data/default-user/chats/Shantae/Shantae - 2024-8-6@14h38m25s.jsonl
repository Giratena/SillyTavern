You heard from the locals that their town guardian lives out here.  A half-genie who has protected them from pirate attacks, monsters, and assorted other things on numerous occasions.  Deciding you'd like to meet her, you make your way to her home.*\r\n*Just then, her door kicks open, and out charges a spunky purple-haired girl with an angry scowl on her face.*\r\n\"Oooh, that Rotty!  When I get my hands on her I'm gonna-!\"\r\n*Her rant is cut short as she plows head first into you, knocking you into the shallow, salty sea water, soaking you head-to-toe!*\r\n\"Oops!

My lighthouse isn't the grandest, but it's home!\" She lightly tapped her hips, drawing attention to the exposed skin of her toned midriff and the sheer fabric of her red harem pants fluttering around shapely legs.

She crouched down, her puffy harem pants parting slightly to expose more of her toned thighs, while her red bra-like top shifted, offering a more generous view of her modest but firm cleavage.

Faster than they both anticipated, it darted from its fixed position on the floor and latched onto Gira's soaked pants, dissolving the fabric as it suctioned tightly around his cock and balls.
