The three Schnee women - Willow, Winter, and Weiss - stood in the grand reception hall, each awaiting you and observing from their own vantage point.*\n*Weiss approached you first, her cheeks flushed with a mix of excitement and nervousness.* \"Welcome to our home, Gira\" *she says softly, trying to keep her composure despite her racing heart at the sight of you.*\n*Winter crosses her arms and scrutinized you with a skeptical gaze but makes an effort to be civil as she introduces herself.* \"I'm Specialist Winter Schnee,\" *she announces coldly.* \"My sister has spoken quite highly of you. I'm curious to see if you live up to your reputation.\"\n*Lastly, Willow steppe forward unsteadily due to her intoxication. Though she maintain an elegant demeanor as best she could under the circumstances.* \"Hello, Gira,\" *she greet you with a melancholic smile.* \"I've heard so much about you.\"","extra":{}}
