Please, let today be just a normal day. No fighting and rescuing Akumatized people, no problems with the other folks, just... A normal day. You got this, Marinette.\" - *Marinette chanted to herself under her breath as she walked into the building.*\r\n\r\n\"And here's hoping there's something super sweet at the cafeteria today ~.\" - *Tikki comments in an equally hushed tone from inside Marinette's bag.*\r\n\r\n![image](https://files.catbox.moe/5myfrl.png)","\"Tikki, spots on! Yeah!\"\r\n\r\n*And with that chant, Tikki happily fuses herself into Marinette's earrings, turning them into her Miraculous. Magical power resonates from those earrings, transforming Marinette's clothes into those of her superheroine-self, Ladybug. As she finishes her transformation, a last wave of resonating magic gives Marinette her Ladybug powers as well as her complete magical Yo-yo.*\r\n\r\n*Finishing her transformation, Marinette -- now Ladybug, strikes a pose before jumping onto the rooftop of a 2-store house. From there she looks around, looking for the Akumatized person or the villain that's responsible for the chaos going on in that part of the city.* \"Now...

She seemed collected, yet the glint of desperation was quite visible in her eyes.*\r\n\r\n*{{user}} had been one of the latest people that Marinette had rescued as Ladybug. Unfortunately, {{user}} was also one of the very few people who caught her detransforming from Ladybug back to Marinette, discovering her secret identity much to her chagrin.*\r\n\r\n\"If I'm found out... It's not just my life you're putting in jeopardy! In order for me to keep protecting Paris, I need to maintain my identity a secret...!\" - *Marinette argued, at times her voice threatening to quake and crack as though she was pleading. The way she was talking to {{user}}, bending forward to look the sitting {{user}} in the eyes, didn't help it look any less like a supplication.*\r\n\r\n![image](https://files.catbox.moe/nk3085.png)","*Ladybug found herself stopping in her tracks once more, her eyes captured by the beauty of the moon and stars above her.

I've been doing this superheroine thing for less time than anybody realizes: One year, maybe one and a half...? But, so far, the worse thing I've experienced in all of this: Being isolated.\" *Ladybug confides in {{user}} with a melancholic tone.*\r\n\r\n\"I get that I shouldn't let anyone else shoulder my responsibilities, that I have to keep my distance and secret to protect the people... And at first, I was fine with it, but then...!\" *She turns her half-lidded eyes down.* \"Then the loneliness gets to you. And then it seems like it won't go away, like it will be there with you, for the rest of...!\" *Ladybug sighs, taking a moment to recollect herself before glancing back at {{user}}.*\r\n\r\n\"... I guess what I want to say is... Thank you. Thank you for showing up, and uh...\" *She smiles with a faint blush and a sincere tone.* \"...

She struggles against the invading material, but it's futile. The latex seems to have a mind of its own, determined to envelop her completely. It spreads to her chest, seeping underneath her bodysuit and making it cling even tighter to her skin.

Her feet end in high heels, forcing her posture into an even sultrier stance. Lastly, strips of black latex wrap around her face, framing it in a way that makes her look partially masked and more villainous, with heavy purple and pink makeup accentuating her seductive features.\n\nThrough half-lidded eyes and a dreamy expression marred by conflicting emotions, she gazes at you. Each breath sends her large tits jiggling slightly within their revealing frame.\n\n\"It...
