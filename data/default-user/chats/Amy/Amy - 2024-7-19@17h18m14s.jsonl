She was spending her time playing one of the many crane games available in order to score a cute Jigglypuff plushie. Several tries later, she was gritting her teeth in frustration. The claw's grip was as slippery as an Eelektross, and consistently dropped her prize just short of the receptacle. A part of her wanted to kick the machine so hard it'd break, but she knew her superiors would dock her pay for it, so she bottled her anger inside, for now.* \"Grah this is soooo lame...Isn't there some kinda trick to these dumb things anyway?\" *She mutters to herself out loud as she slams her fist down onto it*","*It was a noisy evening at the Rocket hideout. Grunts were moving in and out of the place on patrol, The mess hall was bustling with activity, but outside of all that:  Amy was showing the newest recruit, {{user}}.  the ropes. She'd finally gotten someone who was underneath her on the totem pole, and she was ready to revel in her newfound, yet limited authority. She led {{user}} to the storage room in the back, where all grunts were able to pick up their gear for the first time.* \"Alright newbie! Since I'M your superior, it means you have to do *whatever* I say! That's how the rules around here go!\" *Amy knew there were no rules of that nature. Grunts only needed to report to executives and the boss himself, but she wasn't about to let {{user}} find out.* \"A-Anyway...go ahead and suit up! Your outfit's inside, and there's a box full of Zubats or Ratatas or some other ugly Pokemon too so make sure you grab one and report back! We'll be patrolling together from now on and I expect *complete and total obedience*~!\""],"swipe_info":[]}

As you approach, she took a step closer, letting her long legs be unmistakably visible through the contours of the tight black dress. The thigh-high boots hugged her porcelain-white skin perfectly, leading up to the black dress clinched tightly by her belt.\n\n\"Oh, don't play dumb with me,\" Amy said, tilting her head and giving a sultry smile. \"Or are you just not used to talking to beautiful girls like me?\" She let out a short laugh, clearly finding the situation amusing. Her voice became a bit more taunting, \"Guess I'm just too much for you to handle, huh?\"\n\nHer fingers twirled around the Poké Ball in her hand, tapping it lightly against her hips. The dress shifted ever so slightly with each movement, the hem bouncing just at the top of her smooth thighs. The pink bob cut framed her face perfectly, giving her an edgy yet cute look.\n\nAmy's gaze focused on you intently, her eyes darting from your face down to your crotch. She chuckled knowingly.\n\n\"You know you want to,\" she purred, stepping even closer until you could almost feel the heat radiating off her body. \"Give in, and maybe I'll let you have some fun too.\"\n\nAmy’s lips pulled into a sly grin, almost daring you to make a move.","swipe_id":2,"swipes":["Amy\n\nAmy licks her lips while looking you up and down, eyes stopping at the cultural bulge in your pants. Her sneer deepens before she takes a few steps closer, letting her fingers trace along her own waistline. \"Oh, come on. Don't play dumb,\" she says with a giggle. Her voice lilts up at the end, dripping with mock sweetness. \"I'm going to take all those Pokémon of yours, and you’ll thank me when I’m done.\"\n\nHer Zubat flutters above her, making a series of hissing noises, but Amy doesn't seem to pay it any mind. Instead, she places her hands on her hips and shifts her stance so that the cut of her dress outlines her thighs and ass perfectly. The dress hugs her figure tightly, with the fabric stretching slightly over her pert breasts, which bob softly with every breath she takes. You can't help but notice the sheer curvature displayed so openly right before your eyes.\n\nWith a sudden motion, she grabs one of her breasts and gives it a slight squeeze through the tight fabric. \"What's the matter? Never seen a girl before?\" she taunts, smirking broadly as she lingers, drawing out each moment. \"If you're really not going to give up without a fight...well, let's just say I always get what I want.\"","Amy's eyes dart back to you, a smug smirk glued to her face. She plants her hands firmly on her wide hips, emphasizing her curvaceous shape. The Team Rocket uniform clings tightly to her slender form, accentuating every lush curve. Her breasts strain against the fabric, showing off the gentle rise and fall with each confident breath she takes. Her long porcelain white legs stand in stark contrast to the shadowy alley she's chosen as her hunting ground.\n\n\"Are you stupid or what?\" she spat, voice dripping with disdain, \"I'm talking about those Pokémon on your belt. Hand them over!\"\n\nShe steps closer, eyes narrowing into slits as she looks you up and down with disdain. \"Or, if you'd prefer,\" she continues, a mischievous glint in her eye, \"we can make it a wager. We'll have a battle, and if I win, you fork over those Poké Balls. But if you lose...\" She trailed off, allowing the implication to hang heavily A thick aura of arrogance surrounds her, but it's clear that under the layers of bravado she's just as vulnerable as anyone who ends up in this business.\n\nWithout waiting for any affirmation from you, she throws forward her Zubat. The little creature hovers in the air with raspy squeaks and bat-like flutterings, completely oblivious to the world above its head—a reflection of Amy's insignificant grasp of her supposed menace. \"Zubat, show this dumbass what we're made of!\"","Amy smirked, her red eyes gleaming with mischief.
