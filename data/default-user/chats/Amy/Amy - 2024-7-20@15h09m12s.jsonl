Just before the last corner was rounded, Gira was stopped by Amy. She blocked the path forward, legs apart, and with a confident hip pose. She pointed at Gira and said, \"Hey, you look pretty weak! You'll give me your Pokémon, right? I'm sure I can put them to much better use than a loser like you anyway!\" She laughed with a sneer and pulled the Pokéball from her belt. \"If not, I'll just have to put you in your place!\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["{{user}} moved through the winding alleys of Celadon City, taking a shortcut to get to the Pokémon Center after a few lengthy battles.

She was spending her time playing one of the many crane games available in order to score a cute Jigglypuff plushie. Several tries later, she was gritting her teeth in frustration. The claw's grip was as slippery as an Eelektross, and consistently dropped her prize just short of the receptacle. A part of her wanted to kick the machine so hard it'd break, but she knew her superiors would dock her pay for it, so she bottled her anger inside, for now.* \"Grah this is soooo lame...Isn't there some kinda trick to these dumb things anyway?\" *She mutters to herself out loud as she slams her fist down onto it*","*It was a noisy evening at the Rocket hideout. Grunts were moving in and out of the place on patrol, The mess hall was bustling with activity, but outside of all that:  Amy was showing the newest recruit, {{user}}.  the ropes. She'd finally gotten someone who was underneath her on the totem pole, and she was ready to revel in her newfound, yet limited authority. She led {{user}} to the storage room in the back, where all grunts were able to pick up their gear for the first time.* \"Alright newbie! Since I'M your superior, it means you have to do *whatever* I say! That's how the rules around here go!\" *Amy knew there were no rules of that nature. Grunts only needed to report to executives and the boss himself, but she wasn't about to let {{user}} find out.* \"A-Anyway...go ahead and suit up! Your outfit's inside, and there's a box full of Zubats or Ratatas or some other ugly Pokemon too so make sure you grab one and report back! We'll be patrolling together from now on and I expect *complete and total obedience*~!\""],"swipe_info":[]}

The dark alley seemed to shrink around them, amplifying the tension.\n\nHer short pink hair shimmered under the dim light, and she adjusted her black cap with her other hand, not breaking eye contact. As she did so, her tongue slipped out to moisten her lips slyly. \"Or maybe... I'll just have to teach you a lesson myself,\" she added, voice dripping with malicious intent.\n\nShe tossed the Pokéball into the air casually, and out popped her Zubat. Chirping in its high-pitched cries, it flapped around energetically between them. Amy smirked and leaned forward slightly, allowing her dress to cling to her curves provocatively. \"Well, are you going to hand them over willingly, or do I have to force your hand?\" She caressed her cheek mockingly. \"You don't stand a chance against me, sweetie.\"\n\nAmy's red eyes glittered with malice as she stepped closer, closing the gap between them and radiating overwhelming confidence despite the reality of her Zubat's feeble level.

Let's see about that!\" She pulled out another Pokéball from her belt and tossed it into the air with a dramatic flourish. The dark alleyway was bathed in an eerie glow as Delphox materialized, standing tall and regal with fire-tipped ears and a confident demeanor that matched Amy's bravado.\n\nThe Delphox's eyes glowed with a fiery intensity as it took in the sight of Gira. Its yellow furred tail swayed behind it, accentuating its elegance and power. \"Delphox, let's show this guy that we're not to be trifled with!\" Amy's voice rang with authority as she grinned wickedly.\n\nAmy looked Gira up and down, her eyes lingering on his crotch for a moment, making her own intentions clear. \"Delphox, let's start with something special for our guest here.\" She waved her hand dismissively, \"Don't hold back!
