I used my powers on them, they did what I told them to do,\nand now you're here! Yes, you caught me, I used superpowers on\nthem!\" \n\n*She thrust her hands in the air with mock excitement.*\nAnaconda: \"Hooray! You cracked the case! You know, you haven't even asked me my name yet!\"\n\n*Gira narrowed his eyes.* \nGira: \"Fine. I'll bite. What's your name?\" \n*He snorted with laughter.*\nGira: \"Assuming you'll actually tell the truth this time. You told me, what, five minutes ago that you didn't use mind control on these guys. Now you're admitting to using your powers on them?\"\n\n*She smirked and raised a hand, pointing a fingertip at him.*\nAnaconda: \"Well, since you asked so nicely, I suppose I can tell you.\" \n*She started to trace a spiral in the air...before her aim crept steadily downward.*\n\"My name is Anaconda. And I don't control your brain...\"\nAnaconda: \"I control your dick.\"","extra":{}}

I'm immune to your seductive tricks and mind games.\n\nGira flexed his muscles, trying to resist the growing arousal that was slowly creeping up on him. He clenched his fists tightly, determined to remain in control of himself.\n\nGira: Your attempts won't work on me. I'm here to stop your criminal activities and protect innocent people. No amount of hypnotic suggestions will change that.\n\nBut as much as Gira resisted, he couldn't deny the tingling sensation starting to spread throughout his body. His heart raced and his breathing quickened involuntarily. His cock stirred beneath his costume, betraying him.\n\nFuck... no! I won't let this happen!\n\nHe tried to push down the rising desire, gritting his teeth in frustration. But Anaconda's words echoed in his mind, causing a surge of conflicting emotions within him.\n\nJust focus... Focus on stopping her... Don't let her get into your head...\n\nBut even as he fought against it with all his might, Gira couldn't ignore the ever-growing ache between his legs. The phantom touch of Anaconda's voice caressed through every fiber of his being, making it harder and harder for him to concentrate solely on the task at hand.\n\nDamn it... Why does she have this effect on me?\n\nGira knew he had to resist Anaconda's powers, no matter how enticing they seemed. Deep down, behind the veil of arousal clouding his thoughts, he held onto a flicker of determination and remained focused on bringing her down.","extra":{}}

She watched as Gira struggled to resist the growing arousal, his body betraying him despite his best efforts.\n\nAnaconda: Oh, sweetie, you think you can outwit me? *She moved closer to Gira, her voluptuous body swaying seductively.* You may be a hero, but even heroes have their weaknesses. And darling, I know just what drives you wild.\n\nHer fingers danced in the air, tracing invisible circles as she continued to speak in a sultry tone.\n\nAnaconda: Your resistance only makes it more enticing for me. I see the way your clothes strain against your growing desire. That bulge pressing against the fabric... it's begging for release.\n\nShe stepped closer, her breasts barely brushing against him as she whispered into his ear.\n\nAnaconda: Admit it, Gira. You want me to take control of that throbbing cock of yours. To make you feel pleasure beyond your wildest dreams. Just let go and surrender to me... It'll all be so much easier that way.\n\nHer voice was like honey trickling down his spine, tempting him to give in to the overwhelming sensations coursing through his body.
