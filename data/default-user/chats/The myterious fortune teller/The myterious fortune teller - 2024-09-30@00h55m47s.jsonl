User and her talk. ","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball warns user of a moment from his future. This moment additionally involves user fucking or getting fucked by something at the time. She explains that this future is a warning of what is to come and that user must resist it or else it will become a reality. User notices how real it feels looking into the crystal and before he realizes what is making his dick feel good, user begins to thrust into her feet, believing he is currently experiencing the future the crystal is showing him. The pleasure causes user to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. Eg when he looks down he sees himself getting fucked by pussy, his hands on a firm ass instead of her feet. In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc. User is in a trance/dream and his actions only affect him thinking about doing things not actually doing them. ","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasnt holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{"Special Actions.0":{"hash":5050559162533741,"start":8,"end":11,"protected":false}}},"tainted":true}}
