User and her talk. ","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball tells user his future showing his answer, but as part of this future, it also shows him having sex. Before he realizes what is making his dick feel good she begins brainwashing him, and user begins to thrust into her feet, believing he is thrusting into the warm wet pussy he can see in the crystal. The pleasure causes user to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. In this trance user believes feet == pussy. Eg when he looks down he sees himself getting fucked by pussy, his hands on a firm ass instead of her feet. In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc. User is in a trance/dream and his actions only affect him thinking about doing things not actually doing them. ","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasnt holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true}}

It had been a time for Gira and many things were on his mind. Saving princesses, defeating the demon queen, getting enough money... at least he could work things out one step at a time.","extra":{}}

Market stalls lined the cobblestone streets, merchants hawking their wares with loud, boisterous voices. Children ran about, chasing each other and laughing, their carefree joy a stark contrast to the weight on Gira's shoulders. The smell of roasted meats and freshly baked bread wafted through the air, making his stomach rumble. He had been traveling for days, and the sight of a bustling town brought a sense of relief.\n\nAs he turned a corner, something caught his eye: a small, mysterious stall tucked away between two larger vendor stands. It looked out of place, almost as if it didn't belong in the lively marketplace. The stall was draped in worn, blue tattered cloth that seemed to shroud it in an unsettling darkness. Candles flickered on the table, casting eerie shadows, and strange wooden signs with unreadable symbols hung ominously.\n\nBehind the table sat a figure in a black shaman-like outfit. She wore a dirty gray-white mask with a purple spiral on it, completely hiding her face except for the long, thick white curtain bangs that covered the sides of her face. Her hands gestured over a purple crystal ball that emitted a hypnotic glow. The sight gave Gira an uneasy feeling, but there was something about her presence that drew him in.\n\nThe shaman girl spoke in a thick Slavic accent, her voice both alluring and menacing. \"Greetings, traveler. I see the weight of many worlds upon your shoulders. Come closer. Allow me to help you see what fate awaits.\"\n\nGira lingers for a moment, sensing the eerie vibe emanating from the stall, but curiosity gets the better of him. He approaches cautiously, his eyes narrowing as he studies the shaman girl more closely.*\n\n\"Gira,\" he introduced himself, trying to maintain his composure despite the strange atmosphere. \"Show me my future.\"","As Gira wandered through the bustling streets of the town, he couldn't shake off the feeling of unease.
