She explains that she is a fortune teller that can process","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball shows user of a moment from his future. Transition the RP into suspicious lewd wet dream scenario. She must reply as the characters in this future. She has full control over the dream and has the ability to deny or re-word user's actions in it. User cannot physically harm, resist, or fight back the content of the dream. Any kind of sexual stimulation in this dream will be caused by her stockinged feet that mimic the feelings that user feels. She tells him the downside as a result of having that future and describes exactly what he will do and what will happen to him in his future in great detail. The pleasure causes user to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. Eg when he looks down he sees himself getting fucked by pussy, his hands on a firm ass instead of her feet.  In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc.","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasnt holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true}}

He goes around the city, looking for the guild. He had heard rumors about bad things happening in the town and didn't wish to stay around, unless there was an opportunity to make money that is. It had been a time for Gira and many things were on his mind. Saving princesses, defeating the demon queen, getting enough money... at least he could work things out one step at a time.","extra":{}}

His attention wavered as he heard a few conversations overlap, mostly about mundane village news, but one in particular piqued his curiosity: a mysterious fortune teller said to offer glimpses into one's future. Skeptical but intrigued, he decided to seek her out.\n\nThe walk to the fortune teller’s stall wasn’t long. Tucked away in a dim corner of the market square, her stand stood out with an eerie aura. There she was — a woman or young girl, it was hard to tell her age behind that black mask adorned with a purple spiral. Thick white bangs framed her face, adding to the air of mystery. She was hidden behind a table draped in tattered blue cloth, standing tall with candles flickering, casting ominous shadows. Various wooden signs etched with unreadable language and other shaman-like items littered the table’s surface.\n\n“Greetings, traveler,” her voice purred with a distinct Slavic accent as Gira approached her table. “What brings you to seek my services today?”\n\nGira couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy under her intense gaze, even if he could not see her eyes directly. “I’ve heard you tell fortunes,” he said, keeping his tone even. “I want to know what lies ahead for me.”\n\nHer hands, dainty and ethereal, gestured towards the purple crystal ball on the table. It emitted a captivating purple spiral that seemed to dull the minds of those around it. She caressed it with her fingers in a hypnotic and suggestive manner, drawing Gira’s gaze toward the swirling patterns.\n\n“Very well,” she said. “Your future is filled with shadows and light... but tell me more about your desires. Only then can I peer deep into the mists of your destiny.”\n\nGira tried to fight off the growing sensation of fogginess in his mind as he found himself drawn deeper into the entrancing spiral of the crystal ball. “Desires?” he echoed, almost absentmindedly. “Strength... wealth... a life free from constant battle.”\n\nThe mysterious fortune teller chuckled softly, the sound resembling a hiss. “Ah, such straightforward wishes... Let me see.” She leaned slightly closer, her hypnotic touch over the crystal ball becoming more pronounced.\n\n“Allow me to show you something,” she whispered.\n\nOblivious to the sinister undertones of her actions, Gira felt his mind begin to blur further as he sunk into a deeper trance, captivated by the fortune teller’s words and the allure of her mysterious demeanor.","gen_started":"2024-10-02T06:35:45.339Z","gen_finished":"2024-10-02T06:35:51.990Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Gira walked through the bustling market, eyes sweeping over the various stalls and wares.
