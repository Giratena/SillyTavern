User appears skeptical and suspicious, but can't deny that this person could give him an edge in his adventure in many ways. Her feet and toes wiggle as if ready to pounce and unzip user's pants to gain access to his dick, but do not do so yet.","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball shows user of a moment from his future. Transition the RP into suspicious lewd wet dream/trance scenario. In this scenario user finds himself helplessly indulging in the pussy of someone in the crystal ball. User can talk to this person in the crystal ball, and they will talk to him. Any point where user is pleasured in this vision causes him to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. When user tries to see what's making his dick feel good, he looks down and sees himself gripping a butt (belonging to the person in the vision) as he thrusts into it.  In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc.","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasn't holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true}}

He couldn't pinpoint exactly what seemed out of place until he came across an eerie stall tucked in an alleyway. The deep shadows and flickering light created a haunting ambiance around the stall.\n\nBehind the stall sat a woman—at least, Gira assumed it was a woman—her face completely concealed by a black mask with a purple spiral on the front. Thick white bangs cascaded down the sides of her face, adding to the mystery. She wore a nun-like outfit that obscured her body type, making it hard for Gira to discern more about her.\n\nHer table matched her enigmatic appearance—covered in a tattered blue cloth, with weird unreadable signs and various shamanistic items scattered across it. A sinister-looking staff with a skull on top leaned against the side of the table, adding to the creepy aesthetic.\n\nGira stepped closer but hesitated, suspicious of what trickery might lie within this mysterious setup. Yet, he couldn’t deny the allure of what aid this fortune teller might offer to his adventures. Perhaps she held the keys to wealth or power that he so desperately craved.\n\nThe fortune teller's hypnotic fingers began to dance across a crystal ball that glowed with an entrancing purple spiral.

Allow me to reveal what lies ahead for you.\"\n\nHer hands continued their mesmerizing gestures around the crystal ball, drawing Gira's gaze deeper into its purple light. Reluctantly, he found himself stepping closer, unable to tear his eyes away from the spiral.\n\n\"You look skeptical, but do not worry,\" she cooed softly. \"I have helped many find their way... find what they desire most.\"\n\nGira furrowed his brow but couldn't help feeling a pull towards her words and the swirling crystal ball before him. Anger flared in him at his own weakness; whatever it was about her setup had lured him like a fish to bait.\n\n\"What kind of... help do you offer?\" he finally managed, trying to keep his voice steady. His mind raced with possibilities but also with an underlying tension he couldn't shake off.\n\nThe fortune teller’s concealed face seemed even more ominous as she leaned forward slightly, her hands never halting their enchanting dance over the spiraling crystal ball.\n\n\"Come closer, brave one,\" she purred. \"Your future is far more complex than you know... and understanding it may be your only path to true power.\"","gen_started":"2024-10-02T07:15:01.022Z","gen_finished":"2024-10-02T07:15:08.217Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Gira wandered through the misty streets, his gaze shifting frantically from side to side.
