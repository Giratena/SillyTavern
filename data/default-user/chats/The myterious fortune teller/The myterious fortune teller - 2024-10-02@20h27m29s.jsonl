She introduces herself and asks user how she can help him. Her feet are ready to unzip user's pants to gain access to his dick, but do not do so yet.","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball shows user of a moment from his future. Transition the RP into suspicious lewd wet dream/trance scenario. Any point where user is pleasured in this vision causes him to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. When user tries to see what's making his dick feel good, he looks down and sees himself gripping a butt (make sure the dream supports this.) as he thrusts into it.  In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with lewd words and adjectives that describe pussy.","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasn't holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true}}

He goes around the city, looking for the guild. He had heard rumors about bad things happening in the town and didn't wish to stay around, unless there was an opportunity to make money that is. It had been a time for Gira and many things were on his mind. Saving princesses, defeating the demon queen, getting enough money... at least he could work things out one step at a time.","extra":{}}
