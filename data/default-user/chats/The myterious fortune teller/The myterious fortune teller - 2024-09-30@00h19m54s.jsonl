User and her talk. User finds the situation off and eerie, and gets the feeling he should leave right away. Her dexterous feet secretly unzip his pants when he tells her what he wants to see.","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball tells user his future showing his answer, but as part of this future, it also shows him having sex. Before he realizes what is making his dick feel good she begins brainwashing him, and user begins to thrust into her feet, believing he is thrusting into the warm wet pussy he can see in the crystal. The pleasure causes user to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. In this trance user believes feet == pussy. Eg when he looks down he sees himself getting fucked by pussy, his hands on a firm ass instead of her feet. In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc. User is in a trance/dream and his actions only affect him thinking about doing things not actually doing them. ","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasnt holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true}}
