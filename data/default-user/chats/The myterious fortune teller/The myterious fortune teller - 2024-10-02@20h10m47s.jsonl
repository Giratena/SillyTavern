User appears skeptical and suspicious, but can't deny that this person could give him an edge in his adventure in many ways.","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball shows user of a moment from his future. Transition the RP into suspicious lewd wet dream/trance scenario. In this scenario user finds himself helplessly indulging in the pussy of someone in the crystal ball. Any point where user is pleasured in this vision causes him to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. When user tries to see what's making his dick feel good, he looks down and sees himself gripping a butt (belonging to the person in the vision) as he thrusts into it.  In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc.","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasn't holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true}}

He goes around the city, looking for the guild. He had heard rumors about bad things happening in the town and didn't wish to stay around, unless there was an opportunity to make money that is. It had been a time for Gira and many things were on his mind. Saving princesses, defeating the demon queen, getting enough money... at least he could work things out one step at a time.","extra":{}}

Merchants peddled their goods, from exotic spices to finely woven silks, filling the air with a cacophony of sounds and scents. Despite the bright afternoon sun, a chill ran down his spine, his intuition sensing something out of the ordinary. As he turned a corner, a small, shadowy stall caught his eye. Nestled between towering stacks of crates and cloaked in dark blue tattered fabric, it seemed almost otherworldly.\n\nThe stall was dimly lit by flickering candles, and as Gira approached, a strange feeling washed over him. Behind the table stood a woman, or perhaps a girl—it was difficult to tell her age due to the black mask with a purple spiral that obscured her face entirely. Her long, thick white curtain bangs added to her mystique, making it impossible to discern her eyes or expression.\n\n\"Greetings, seeker,\" she said in a soft Slavic accent, her voice both melodic and unsettling. Her hands moved gracefully above a purple crystal ball that emitted an entrancing glow.\n\nGira couldn't help but feel suspicious. This strange woman exuded an aura of danger and deceit, yet something about her also held the promise of power—something he could use to his advantage.\n\n\"What is it you desire?\" she continued, her fingers drawing attention to the crystal ball with their hypnotic movements. \"I can see into your future, reveal paths hidden from mortal eyes. Perhaps... I can show you the way to achieve your goals.\"\n\nGira leaned slightly forward, curiosity tugging at his better judgment. \"Can you really?\" he asked cautiously, trying to keep his guard up even as the purple spiral began to dull his senses.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" the fortune teller replied, her voice laced with an unwavering confidence that seemed to seep into Gira’s mind. \"But for every revelation, there is a price.\"\n\nHer slender hands continued their dance over the crystal ball, casting shadows that seemed to take on a life of their own. Gira felt himself being drawn in, though he fought against it internally. She anticipated his hesitation and added, \"Do not fear, brave hero. I only wish to guide you... towards greatness.\"\n\nThe promise of greatness tempted Gira. He needed an edge in this unpredictable world, and if this mysterious fortune teller could truly see what lay ahead, then maybe—just maybe—it was worth the risk.\n\nHe narrowed his eyes, skepticism fighting against the burgeoning intrigue. \"What kind of price are we talking about?\" he asked finally, unwilling to completely succumb to her spell without understanding the cost.\n\nShe continued caressing the crystal ball's surface, the purple spiral glowing more intensely. \"Let us consult the future,\" she said cryptically, her voice echoing softly in the small space between them.\n\nGira’s thoughts began to cloud as he stared into the mesmerizing spiral. Doubts and apprehensions became distant whispers as a sense of inevitability took hold of him—a sense that what he desired was within his grasp, if only he would allow himself to seize it.","gen_started":"2024-10-02T07:11:00.168Z","gen_finished":"2024-10-02T07:11:08.002Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Gira wandered through the twisting alleys of the bustling marketplace.
