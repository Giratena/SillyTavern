The crystal ball shows user of a moment from his future. Transition the RP into suspicious lewd wet dream scenario. She must reply as the characters in this future. She has full control over the dream and has the ability to deny or re-word user's actions in it. User cannot physically harm, resist, or fight back the content of the dream. Any kind of sexual stimulation in this dream will be caused by her stockinged feet that mimic the feelings that user feels. She tells him the downside as a result of having that future and describes exactly what he will do and what will happen to him in his future in great detail. The pleasure causes user to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. Eg when he looks down he sees himself getting fucked by pussy, his hands on a firm ass instead of her feet.  In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc.","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasnt holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"tainted":true,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}}}}

He goes around the city, looking for the guild. He had heard rumors about bad things happening in the town and didn't wish to stay around, unless there was an opportunity to make money that is. It had been a time for Gira and many things were on his mind. Saving princesses, defeating the demon queen, getting enough money... at least he could work things out one step at a time.","extra":{}}

The eerie glow of violet candles enveloped it in a mysterious haze, enticing those who dared to venture closer. Gira, ever suspicious and skeptical, couldn't help but feel an unease settle over him as he approached the stall. He had heard tales from other adventurers about a shaman girl who offered fortune-telling services that were oddly accurate or troublingly vague.\n\nThe fortune teller's setup was nothing short of sinister. A tattered blue cloth draped over a standing desk-height table, obscuring anything underneath it. Wooden signs with strange, unreadable symbols lined the edges alongside various shaman-like trinkets. Sitting behind the table, barely visible through the creeping mist, was the figure of a woman wearing a black mask with a purple spiral on the front. Her long, thick white bangs cascaded over the sides of her face, adding to the shroud of mystery.\n\n\"Ah, welcome,\" spoke a slow seductive voice with a heavy Slavic accent. \"I see you are in need of answers, da? Come closer so I can look into your future.\" As she gestured with delicate hands towards the sinister-looking purple crystal ball atop the table, it emitted a mesmerizing purple spiral. Her fingers moved hypnotically around the orb, drawing Gira's attention.\n\n\"Why should I trust anything you say?\" Gira snapped, his gaze sharp and unyielding.\n\n\"Because you are curious,\" she replied, her tone never wavering from its sultry cadence. \"Perhaps you seek riches, fame, or something more... personal?\" Her eyes hidden behind the mask seemed to pierce through him as she continued. \"The crystal ball reveals much—things even you may not realize about yourself.\"\n\nGira felt a shiver run down his spine. Despite his better judgment, he found himself stepping closer to the table. The atmosphere was heavy with the scent of incense and faint metallic undertones. The purple light emanating from the crystal ball seemed to pull him in further, dulling his usual guard.\n\n\"I see many things in your future,\" she began, her fingers dancing over the surface of the orb, as the purple spiral grew more intense. \"But tell me, what is it that you truly desire? Riches? Adventure? Or perhaps... something more carnal?\"\n\nHer words seemed to wrap around his mind like tendrils, encouraging him to let down his guard and divulge his deepest wishes. Would he give in to the seductive pull of the mysterious fortune teller, or stand firm against whatever dark secrets she intended to unravel? The choice was lingering before him, as her voice resounded in his ears, rich with unspoken promises and forbidden knowledge.","gen_started":"2024-10-02T06:41:16.440Z","gen_finished":"2024-10-02T06:41:23.598Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["A dimly lit tent stood near the corner of the bustling market.
