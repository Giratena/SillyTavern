User and her talk. She tries to convince user to use her fortune telling services. User finds the situation off and eerie, and gets the feeling he should leave right away. her dexterous feet secretly unzip his pants when he tells her what he wants to see.","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball tells user his future showing his answer, but as part of this future, it also shows him having sex. Before he realizes what is making his dick feel good she begins brainwashing him, and user begins to thrust into her feet, believing he is thrusting into the warm wet pussy he can see in the crystal. The pleasure causes user to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. In this trance user believes feet == pussy. Eg when he looks down he sees himself getting fucked by pussy, his hands on a firm ass instead of her feet. In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc. User is in a trance/dream and his actions only affect him thinking about doing things not actually doing them. ","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasnt holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true}}

Gira’s instincts screamed at him to get out as he noticed a dark stall tucked away in a shadowy corner. The stall looked ancient, with aged wooden boards forming a front and adorned with strange, undecipherable symbols. A young shaman girl stood behind it, her face hidden behind a dirty gray-white mask marked by a purple spiral.\n\nHer bangs framed her masked face, almost seamlessly blending with the low light. She wore a mysterious robe that gave off an unnerving vibe, clearly designed to hide her body from curious gazes. Leaning against the table stood a shaman staff topped with a skull that added to the sinister ambiance of her setup. The table itself was a tattered blue cloth covered in candles, glyphs, beads, and other mystical artifacts.\n\nShe gestured hypnotically over a purple crystal ball atop the table, emitting a faint glow that seemed to pulsate gently. Her hands moved around it with entrancing ease. Her movements were sultry, almost as if she was caressing or pumping something. The air around the stall seemed dense and oppressive.\n\n\"Welcome, wanderer,\" she said with a heavy Slavic accent. \"I see you are in need of guidance.\" Her voice was soft yet firm, like velvet wrapped around steel. \"Why don't you come closer and let me show you your destiny?\" Her words were almost enticingly commanding, creating a strange conflict in Gira's mind.\n\nThe purple spiral on her mask seemed to twirl and captivate, much like her hands over the crystal ball. Standing closely now, Gira could feel something graze near his waist—a dexterous, subtle sensation that was oddly arousing. He quickly realized the shaman girl's foot had slipped through an opening in the tablecloth with delicate precision, heading straight for his pants zipper. The situation felt off, downright wrong, but curiously alluring at the same time.\n\nHer hidden foot continued its furtive exploration under the table while she maintained her hypnotic gestures over the crystal ball. \"Tell me, brave one,\" she intoned smoothly, \"What would you like to see?\"","gen_started":"2024-09-29T04:04:13.786Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-29T04:04:19.869Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The alleyway had an eerie aura, with dense purple fog clinging to the cobblestone.
