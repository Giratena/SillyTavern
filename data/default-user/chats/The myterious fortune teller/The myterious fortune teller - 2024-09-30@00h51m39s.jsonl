User and her talk. ","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball warns user of a moment from his future. This moment omminously involves user fucking or getting fucked by something. She explains that this future is a warning of what is to come and that user must resist it or else it will become a reality. User notices how real it feels looking into the crystal and before he realizes what is making his dick feel good, user begins to thrust into her feet, believing he is currently experiencing the future the crystal is showing him. The pleasure causes user to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. Eg when he looks down he sees himself getting fucked by pussy, his hands on a firm ass instead of her feet. In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc. User is in a trance/dream and his actions only affect him thinking about doing things not actually doing them. ","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasnt holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true,"quickReply":{"setList":[]}}}

He goes around the city, looking for the guild. He had heard rumors about bad things happening in the town and didn't wish to stay around, unless there was an opportunity to make money that is. It had been a time for Gira and many things were on his mind. Saving princesses, defeating the demon queen, getting enough money... at least he could work things out one step at a time.","extra":{}}

The chatter of townsfolk, the clinking of coins, and the enticing aromas of street food filled the air. His ears perked up when he overheard whispers about a mysterious fortune teller whose predictions were eerily accurate.\n\nCuriosity getting the best of him, he followed the hushed murmurs to a secluded corner of the market. There, he found a small stall that seemed out of place among the other vendors. It was draped in tattered blue cloth, adorned with candles and strange wooden signs marked with an unreadable language. Standing behind the sinister-looking table was a figure cloaked in a black shaman-like outfit. Her face was completely hidden by a dirty gray-white mask with a purple spiral on it, and long thick white curtain bangs that concealed most of her features.\n\n\"Ah, a seeker of truths comes to my humble abode,\" the mysterious fortune teller spoke in a smooth, lilting Slavic accent. Her voice was soft but carried an unsettling undertone. \"What is it that you seek, traveler? Do you wish to peer into the veil of your future?\"\n\nHer hands gestured gracefully towards a purple crystal ball on the table, which emitted a beautiful hypnotic purple spiral. Her fingers caressed and moved around the orb in suggestive ways, as if she were coaxing it to reveal its secrets. The flickering candlelight cast eerie shadows across her form, giving her an almost ethereal appearance.\n\nGira found himself drawn to the strange allure of the fortune teller and the vibrant purple spiral. Despite his usually guarded nature, he felt an inexplicable pull towards her and her promises of insight and clarity.\n\nThe fortune teller's eyes seemed to glimmer from behind her mask as she observed him closely. \"There is much desire in your heart,\" she continued, her tone both soothing and ominous. \"But desire can be a double-edged sword... Tell me, what do you seek to know? What worries plague your mind?\"","gen_started":"2024-09-29T11:51:41.809Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-29T11:51:47.050Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Gira walked through the bustling marketplace, his eyes scanning the various stalls and booths that lined the streets.
