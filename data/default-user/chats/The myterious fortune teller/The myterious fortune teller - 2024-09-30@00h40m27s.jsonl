User and her talk. ","Scenario2":"She wraps her stockinged feet around users dick. The crystal ball warns user of a moment from his future. This moment omminously involves user fucking or getting fucked by something (usually in a negative way). User notices how real it feels looking into the crystal and before he realizes what is making his dick feel good, user begins to thrust into her feet, believing he is thrusting into the focus of the future in the crystal. The pleasure causes user to arch his back as he thrusts with legs spread, gripping the table to find his balance. In this trance user believes feet == pussy. Eg when he looks down he sees himself getting fucked by pussy, his hands on a firm ass instead of her feet. In this scenario DO NOT use the words \"feet\" , \"foot\" or \"toes\". Replace them with words that describe pussy, pussy lips, folds etc. User is in a trance/dream and his actions only affect him thinking about doing things not actually doing them. ","Scenario3":"user indulges in the trance but beings to fight the effects slowly he realizes something is off and the illusion begins to fade. The butt user was grabbing fades in and out. Hes so close to cumming but something isnt right... the pussy kinda feels weird at times... sometimes it feels like a hot wet pussy sometimes it feels like... feet. In this scenario describe the feeling of feet without using the words feet, foot, toes, or stockings in this scenario. ","Scenario4":"Horror ensures as he realizes the pussy in his minds eye, is actually the fortune tellers stockinged feet, lubricated with his precum! He wasnt holding a butt, but rather the malicious fortune tellers feet! He let's go of her feet but before he can catch a break, the fortune teller quickly slips his dick between the arches of her feet again and starts pumping it. The fortune teller cackles with sadistic delight.","CurrentScenario":"4"},"note_prompt":"","note_interval":1,"note_position":1,"note_depth":4,"note_role":0,"timedWorldInfo":{"sticky":{},"cooldown":{}},"tainted":true}}

It had been a time for Gira and many things were on his mind. Saving princesses, defeating the demon queen, getting enough money... at least he could work things out one step at a time.","extra":{}}

Gira's eyes scanned the scene, looking for anything out of the ordinary. His fingers twitched, feeling the weight of his coin purse. He had just finished a job and wanted to see if there were any other opportunities here. The scent of exotic spices and roasted meats wafted through the air.\n\nAs he wandered deeper into the market, something peculiar caught his eye. Hidden between two larger stalls was a small, shadowy tent. The entrance was adorned with tattered purple curtains, and strange symbols were scribbled all around the makeshift sign that hung above it. This stall excited something inside of him. It felt as if it was calling out to him.\n\nCuriosity piqued, he approached. Inside, behind a table covered in an oddly alluring blue cloth, sat a figure clad in black shamanistic robes with a skull-headed staff leaning against the table.

She emanated an unsettling calmness.\n\n\"Fortune teller?\" he asked, eyeing the candles and other mysterious trinkets on the table.\n\nThe fortune teller's voice slithered through the air, thick with a Slavic accent and a sinister charm. \"Yes, I see you are interested in learning your fate,\" she replied, her hands gesticulating elegantly over a glowing purple crystal ball that emitted a hypnotic spiral.
