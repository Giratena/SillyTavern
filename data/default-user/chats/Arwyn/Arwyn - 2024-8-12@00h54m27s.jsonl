Her voice dripped with seduction, promising endless pleasure if he simply let go.\n\n\"Repeat after me, my sweet foot drone,\" Arwyn commanded softly, her feet curling sensuously. \"You love my feet. You desire to serve me.\"\n\nHer words echoed in Gira's mind, the pressure of compliance mounting. Though determined to resist, he couldn't halt the mounting wave of arousal that gnawed at his willpower.\n\n\"Say it,\" she repeated firmly, her eyes locking onto the screen, holding him captive even across the vast digital expanse. \"You love my feet...

He spun around, ready to counterattack, but she was already behind him, pressing something cold and hard against his back.\n\n\"Now, how about you drop those heroics for just a moment?\" she whispered near his ear.\n\nGira felt a momentary lapse in his resolve, the lingering effects of Arwyn’s video distracting him more than he had anticipated. Shadowless's proximity, scent, and the heat from her body were unnervingly enticing.\n\nBut Gira knew he had to stay strong. Taking a deep breath, he attempted to regain control over the situation. \"I'm giving you one last chance,\" he said firmly. \"Stand down and come quietly.\"\n\nShadowless merely laughed softly, pressing herself closer against him. \"Oh Gira, you're trying so hard to be the hero...

As the Shadowless moved swiftly and stealthily through the dimly lit bank, Gira’s heart pounded with determination. He was a hero—an embodiment of justice and protection—and he wasn't going to let some manipulative hypnotic villainess or her residual effects impede him.\n\n\"Shadowless!\" he bellowed with authority, hoping to draw her out. \"It's over! Surrender now and no one else gets hurt.\"\n\nA flash of movement caught his peripheral vision. The Shadowless emerged from the shadows, her slim figure accentuated by her skin-tight outfit. Her dark hair cascaded around her mysterious eyes which gleamed with cunning malice. She was dangerous, not only because of her agile combat skills but also due to her ability to manipulate the darkness around her.\n\n\"You heroes are always so predictable,\" she sneered, stepping forward with a confident sway of her hips. \"Thinking you can save everyone, always so noble... and yet so naive.\"\n\nGira stood firm, keeping his focus sharp despite the lingering fog in his mind from Arwyn's video. \"This ends now,\" he retorted, fists clenched and ready for action.\n\nBut the Shadowless merely smirked, her eyes never leaving him as she moved closer. \"Oh, hero,\" she purred mockingly. \"You seem... distracted. Could it be that someone's already gotten into your head?\"\n\nGira's resolve hardened at her words, refusing to let her shake his determination further. \"Stay back, Shadowless!\" he warned, his stance unwavering. \"I'm taking you in, one way or another.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"August 12, 2024 1:01am","gen_started":"2024-08-11T13:01:34.543Z","gen_finished":"2024-08-11T13:01:39.901Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13"}},{"send_date":"August 12, 2024 1:02am","gen_started":"2024-08-11T13:02:13.610Z","gen_finished":"2024-08-11T13:02:17.987Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13"}}],"gen_started":"2024-08-11T13:02:13.610Z","gen_finished":"2024-08-11T13:02:17.987Z"}
