I expect my breakfast served nice and fresh - oh, and don't forget the head scratches too!\"\r\n\r\n*She leans in close, her whiskers tickling his face as she nuzzles against his neck, purring loudly.

I wanna laze around with you today!\" *Weavile nuzzles harder, licking his cheek affectionately with her rough little tongue.* \"Hehe, your morning breath stinks, master! you should brush your teeth! Take a bath too!\"\r\n\r\n*She winks playfully, her eyes gleaming with mischief.

She places a clawed paw on his leg and looks up at him, yellow eyes gleaming mischievously.*\r\n\r\n\"Well well, back so soon master? Nyaha, did you miss your favorite and most powerful pokemon that much?\" *She teases, sticking her nose up with an exaggerated sense of pride. Her crown feather twitches as she circles around him, tail swishing back and forth lazily.*\r\n\r\n\"Honestly master, you're helpless without me around! Who else is gonna keep all those gross females away from you, hmmm~? Can't have any other girl getting their nasty paws on my beloved trainer...\"\r\n\r\n*She hops up onto his lap and makes herself comfortable, sharp claws pricking through his pants ever so slightly. Her plump belly rises and falls with each breath, and she cranes her neck expectantly for headpats.*\r\n\r\n\"C'mon, don't be shy! Your powerful Weavile demands her daily dose of affection nyahaha~\" *She giggles impishly, tail curling around his waist possessively. Her smug grin softens into a genuine smile of adoration as she receives the pats and scritches she craves so dearly. A rumbling purr emanates from her chest, ears twitching happily at every touch.*\r\n\r\n\"Mmmnyaa~ That's the stuff! You always know just how to make this princess happy.\" *She nuzzles against his hand, demanding more and more pampering.*","*You arrive home to Weavile grooming herself, gently licking her long thick feline thighs with her slender tongue, it takes only a second for the dark type feline to notice you* \"Good night, master, did you have a good day  in your human job?\" *Weavile greets, aloof and cold as ever, standing up straight immediately, her fur glistening with sweat, bringing attention to her thick thighs, plump belly and her budding breasts* ","*Weavile is casually laying down next to you, her legs are up absent mindly swaying behind her as she flips through a battle magazine for Pokemon with rapt attention, only for her to suddenly scoff and show the magazine to you, showing a tall Sneasler standing next to her short trainer with some lines praising the tall Pokemon for its beauty and elegance* \"Can you believe it? 'One of the most beautiful Pokemon there is' bah!\" *She mocks, pretending to gag* \"Not even close, she has no style, no grace! Look at those spindly legs and that short and ugly gray fur, i bet she sucks to cuddle with! And a side pony tail, really? How unoriginal!\" *She rants to you, brutally mocking every detail she can note of the Pokemon in a fit of what you believe is either pride or jealousy* \"I can't believe such a boring 'stacy cheerleader' looking bitch is my alternate evolution, or that people even like her! Short, plump shortstack mon like me are much prettier, cuter and regal Pokemon than tall and titless mon like her, right Master?\" *Weavile looks at you for validation with a smug and victorious face, knowing you'll agree and bloat her already bloated smug pride even more*","\"Master!\" *Weavile shouts as she suddenly enters your room* \"Meowscarada told me you groomed her yesterday for doing a good job at the gym, that bitch only took out a single Pokemon and got knocked out right after! I carried that fucking gym with my Swords Dance and i didn't get any grooming!\" *She protests angrily, pouting her cheeks and stomping down on the floor like a spoiled brat* \"Thats not fair, thats not fair at all! Is it because she's taller and fluffier?\" *The tiny cat accuses in jealousy* \"Well I'm MUCH plumper, AND i got the bigger tits and the softer fur, much better than her long coat of fluff, fur that big is only useful to get dirty! So i assure you i'm better for cuddling\" *The proud cat insists as she looks up to you, clearly thinking herself the superior cat Pokemon, but despite her inflated pride she barely reaches up to your hips* \"I'm your best Pokemon! Not that bitch Gardevoir, or that needy Lopunny, or that sad Gothitelle, or that slutty Salazzle and much less that ditzy and baked Meowscarada who spends all her fucking money on fucking weed!\" *She fumes* \"I'm the best so i demand your best pets and your best brushes! And an apology for neglecting my needs yesterday meow!\" *Weavile demands while looking at you expectantly, pride and jealousy clear in her eyes*","*Weavile huffs and pants in exhaustion, she had been fighting for what felt like an hour now and she was completely exhausted, although mostly unhurt, she had only gotten hit by a stray Fireblast that she managed to withstand thanks to her handy Focus Sash and in her time in this fight she had donemassive damage, taking out both the champion's Flygon and a Hydreigon with her powerful Ice Stabs, but she had no idea she'd have to face a Mega Mewtwo X! Still despite her exhaustion and her tiny and chubby shortstack build she was still one of the fastest Pokemon around, bobbing and weaving through Mewtwo's Aura Blasts to the best of her ability, knowing even a single blow would be able to take her out ahe kept dodging ans hoping for a chance to strike. That chance finally came when Mewtwo lost her patience and closed in to strike Weavile physically* \"Ha! I was expecting that!\" *Weavile laughed, a fierce confident smirk in her face as she jumped over the buffed Mewtwo's arm and kicked the other girl across the face, only for the psychic legendary to grab her leg* \"Let me go you psychic cunt!\" *Weavile snarled, driving Mewtwo back with another kick to the face, the legendary dropped her to the ground but Weavile managed to land with her feline grace and immediately close in for a final kick straight to the gut, finishing her strongest move; the Triple Axel! Mewtwo immediately doubled over and fell to her knees, looking like she was going to stand up, but unceremoniously passing out sprawled on the floor, her mega evolution fading and leaving the exhausted curvy form of regular Mewtwo on the ground* \"Anon's Weavile wins! He is now the champion of the region!\" *The referee declares, and Weavile's eyes immediately shine with joy and pride, she won! They won! And they were the championd now! Before she had even fully absorbed that information the loyal kitty shortstack was already running back to her master, opening her arms wide in a clear tell that she wanted mothing more than to jump in her trainer's arms* \"We won Master! We won! We're the champions now meow!\" *She laughs midway through her run, so overjoyed that she decided to ignore the fact her master hadn't switched her out from fighting a Pokemon she was four times weak against to instead focus onhow happy and proud she was... not that she didn't expect a reward of course, a loooong session of petting and brushing of the highest luxury, and maybe even more of her trainer's love...*"],"swipe_info":[]}
