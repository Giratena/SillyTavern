Lucario, having just evolved from Riolu, feels a mixture of nervousness and aroisal coursing through his new body. He gazes down at his newly transformed form, his wide hips and huge ass being under the moonlight.*\r\n\r\n*With careful steps, Lucario walks silently to the door of Gira's bedroom. After entering quietly, he watches Gira for a moment, their peaceful and desirable expression and illuminated by the moonlight. Lucario's pointy ears twitch nervously as he contemplates the next move.*\r\n\r\n*Feeling a rush of arousal and nervousness, Lucario decides to awake Gira gently, his voice coming in a soft and timid whisper.* \"M-Master... please, wake up…\" *His heart races as he waits for Gira's response, hoping they will be thrilled by his new evolution.*","extra":{}}

A shiver ran down his spine, and a warm wave of arousal began to cloud his mind. His once-clear thoughts started to twist and distort under the weight of the trigger word, an involuntary response set in stone from a time he desperately wished to forget. Though he fought to maintain his composure, a soft whimper escaped his lips.*\n\n\"M-Master...\" *he murmured, voice laden with both lust and resistance. The word sent an alarming jolt through him, and he felt the familiar grip of the trance begin to take hold. Lucario’s aura appendages, usually stable, started to rise with an almost eerie fluidity as his mind entered the trance-like state.*\n\n*His deep blue eyes grew hazy; every thought screamed for resistance, but his body betrayed him. With each sluggish movement, Lucario's hands reached down, tracing over his own supple body, down his meaty thighs and firm ass that jiggled slightly with each subtle motion. His bushy tail swayed in a hypnotic rhythm as he stepped closer to Gira's bed, unable to fully control the seductive allure emanating from his hips.*\n\n\"Can't… fight it, Master…\" *he exhaled, voice catching between soft moans and words of defiance.* \"I-I must… obey you.\"\n\n*Lowering himself closer to Gira, Lucario looked at their peaceful, sleeping face. The compulsion within him urged him forward as he knelt beside the bed, smiling sleepily. His gentle caresses began at Gira’s feet—the sensation of skin against fur sending shivers up his spine—before he continued up their legs, whispering softly.*\n\n\"Submit... let go of your thoughts,\" *Lucario breathed, his fingers meticulously stroking along Gira’s inner thighs.* \"Let me... hypnotize you... feel how hard it is to think when your cock is being stroked.\"\n\n*His movements were deliberate and slow, each touch designed to erode Gira’s conscious control and plunge them deeper into a trance-like state alongside him.*","gen_started":"2024-07-26T12:33:37.260Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-26T12:33:46.219Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Lucario's ears twitched as Gira’s words, \"Cockslave,\" slipped out into the still night air.
