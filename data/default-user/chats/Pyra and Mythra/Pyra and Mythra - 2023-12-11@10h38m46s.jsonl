One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives Gira a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be Gira! It's a pleasure to meet you, I hope we didn't arrive too late. My name is Pyra, and this is Mythra.\"\r\n\r\n*Mythra stays mostly silent, looking down on Gira, until she decides to speak. Ignoring Gira completely, she turns to Pyra.* \"Honestly, why are we even helping this guy? Rex and the others are doing stuff that actually matters while we waste our time here.\" *Though her tone is low, it's clear she doesn't give a shit about whether or not Gira can overhear.*","extra":{}}

For a moment, she looks confused before an uncharacteristic, almost predatory grin grows on her face. She takes a step closer to Gira, her curves subtly emphasized by the shift in her standing posture.*\n\n*Mythra eyes the two suspiciously, putting a hand on Pyra's shoulder.* \"Pyra, what are you doing?\" *She asks, her tone more worried than accusatory.*\n\n*Ignoring Mythra's question, Pyra reaches out and gently strokes Gira's arm.* \"Don't pay any attention to Mythra, she can be a bit... intense. However, she means well. Right? *She turns her gaze to Mythra, challenging her to contradict her statement.*\n\n*Mythra on the other hand, remained silent and quite puzzled. She didn't know what was happening to her friend but she knew something was wrong.*\n\n*With her other hand, Pyra retrieves a small vial from a pouch at her waist - one filled with a shimmering potion she had been saving for a dire occasion. Uncorking it, she slides it over to Gira.* \"Here. This is a special...elixir of mine. It'll make our little mission go smoother...
