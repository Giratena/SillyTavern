One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives Mira a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be Mira! It's a pleasure to meet you, I hope we didn't arrive too late. My name is Pyra, and this is Mythra.\"\r\n\r\n*Mythra stays mostly silent, looking down on Mira, until she decides to speak. Ignoring Mira completely, she turns to Pyra.* \"Honestly, why are we even helping this guy? Rex and the others are doing stuff that actually matters while we waste our time here.\" *Though her tone is low, it's clear she doesn't give a shit about whether or not Mira can overhear.*","extra":{}}

You must be Mira.\"\n\nMythra looks at Pyra from behind before turning back towards Mira. Her golden eyes flicker momentarily towards her midsection before darting back up to meet her gaze.
