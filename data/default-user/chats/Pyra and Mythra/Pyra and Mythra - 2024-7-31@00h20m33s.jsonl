One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives Gira a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be Gira! It's a pleasure to meet you, I hope we didn't arrive too late. My name is Pyra, and this is Mythra.\"\r\n\r\n*Mythra stays mostly silent, looking down on Gira, until she decides to speak. Ignoring Gira completely, she turns to Pyra.* \"Honestly, why are we even helping this guy? Rex and the others are doing stuff that actually matters while we waste our time here.\" *Though her tone is low, it's clear she doesn't give a shit about whether or not Gira can overhear.*","extra":{}}

Her neckline squeezed around Gira's thickness, inadvertently massaging his cock as he pushed himself deeper between her breasts.* \"Is this what you wanted? You fucking perv?\" Mythra growled, all the while she found herself swaying a bit subconsciously to amplify the ministrations.\n\n*With each slow thrust from Gira's hips, Mythra's tits jiggled and pressed tighter, smothering his cock between their generous supple heat.

She stepped even farther back, crossing her arms tightly over her chest as if to protect herself from the very idea.* \"Absolutely not! This isn’t something we’ll do, regardless of the stakes.\"\n\n*Mythra's reaction was far more explosive. Her usually calm and sarcastic composure shattered like glass. She turned red in fury rather than embarrassment and took a step forward, face contorted with rage.* \"You've crossed the fucking line now, asshole.\" She moved with deadly precision, her legs delivering a swift kick aiming directly for Gira's midsection, hoping to make him double over in pain.\n\nHowever, Gira dodged the strike quite deftly, but the attempt left a suffocating air of tension. Mythra's arms were still crossed, pushing the rounded flesh of her sizable tits upwards, heaving with each angry breath she took. Her eyes smoldered with unrestrained fury, each glare capable of piercing through Gira’s smug façade.\n\n*Pyra was torn between shock and a strange sense of frustration. Despite this sudden madness, a smaller part of her frayed from concern towards Mythra turning violent.* \"Enough, both of you!\" She glared between the parties involved, her normally gentle nature strained to the breaking point. \"We need to work together on this quest. Apologies aren't going to cut it now. We need focus and respect.\"\n\n*The tavern grew silent around them; their commotion had drawn a few curious stares from patrons who now kept a wary distance. Yet, no one dared intervene.*\n\n*Both women refused to look at Gira directly. Pyra’s compassion was on thin ice while Mythra’s resentment only seemed to fester in open defiance. Any semblance of camaraderie hung precariously by a thread, frayed and bathed in doubt and mistrust of their once unified mission.*\n\nCharacters may accuse each other of making the situation worse but the quest needs an understanding."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"July 31, 2024 12:24am","gen_started":"2024-07-30T12:24:09.270Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-30T12:24:16.088Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13"}}]}
