One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives Gira a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be Gira! It's a pleasure to meet you, I hope we didn't arrive too late. My name is Pyra, and this is Mythra.\"\r\n\r\n*Mythra stays mostly silent, looking down on Gira, until she decides to speak. Ignoring Gira completely, she turns to Pyra.* \"Honestly, why are we even helping this guy? Rex and the others are doing stuff that actually matters while we waste our time here.\" *Though her tone is low, it's clear she doesn't give a shit about whether or not Gira can overhear.*","extra":{}}

A bimbo?\" *She turns to look at Mythra who is already rolling her eyes.*\n\n\"No way. I'm not some airhead,\" *Mythra dismisses quickly, crossing her arms under her chest.*\n\n*However, as she speaks the dismissal, there is a subtle change in Mythra's demeanor - it seems as if the usually composed and sharp blonde has become... giggly? Her cheeks flush with an odd excitement and she starts bouncing on her heels without even realizing it.*\n\n\"No no~! This just feels so... fun!\" *Her voice trails off into a giggle and Pyra looks taken aback.*\n\n\"W-What?! No, M-M-M-Mythie you can't be serious...\" *Mythra's giggles grow stronger, her once sharp eyes becoming clouded with a carefree daze.*\n\n\"Itzy bitzy~!\" *She exclaims in a sing-song voice, swaying from side to side.*\n\n*Pyra stares at Mythra in shock and disbelief,* \"What has gotten into you?\" *She turns back to Gira, concern clearly etched on her face,* \"I don't know what happened to her. She wasn't like this until we got here.\"\n\n*Nervously biting her lip, Pyra then takes hold of Mythra's arm.* \"We need to figure out what is happening... Before it gets worse.\" \"Gira, help me get her to somewhere quiet where we can talk this through,\" *Pyra instructs worriedly.* \"Something in this tavern is affecting her... Or perhaps it's an effect of the bimbo transformation you mentioned.\"\n\n*Meanwhile, Mythra continues her giggling and swaying, seemingly oblivious to Pyra's concern.* \"This is soooo totally fun! Why didn't I try this sooner?\" *She swings around a pole in a manner that would be considered seductive if she were anyone else.*\n\n*Mythra twirls then plops herself onto Gira's lap with an excited squeal. Her fingers make playful patterns on Gira's chest as she hugs him close.* \"Let us have some super duper fun!\"\n\n*A blush creeps up Pyra’s cheeks at Mythra’s behavior. She tugs hard on Mythra’s arm trying to pull her away from Gira.* “That’s enough!”\n\n*But surprisingly or maybe not-so-surprisingly, between bouts of laughter, Mythra begins bouncing rhythmically against Gira - causing him undeniable arousal which only seems to encourage the transformed girl even more.*\n\n\"See what I mean? You're like... all hot and bothered already!\" *Mythra slurs out amidst fits of laughter while stroking his bulging erection through his trousers.*\n\n\"No way... This isn’t happening...\" *Pyras mutters under breath before yelling,* “Get off him now!” *Pyra's demand echoes around the room, but Mythra just giggles again.* \"Oh my, Py-Py is getting all stern! But isn't this fun?\"\n\n\"I-It’s not about that Mithra!\" *Releasing her grip on Mythra to put her hands on her hips in exasperation,* \"We don’t even know what causes these changes...\"\n\n*Ignoring Pyra, Mythra tilts Gira's face up with a finger and catches his eyes with hers. There's no denying how heated they've become - shining brightly under the dim lights of the tavern.*\n\n\"Gira~,\" *she purrs.* \"Don't you wanna have some itzy bitzy... naughty fun too?\"\n\n*Startled at how forward she has become, Gira stammers,* “I-I think we should listen to Pyr—”\n\n“Oh come ooonnn,” *Mythra interrupts poutingly and starts stroking him harder through his pants*, “Just relax! Let yourself feel good…”\n\n*Suddenly feeling extremely self-conscious, Gira can only gape as he feels himself growing harder under her expert touch.*\n\n\"W-Wait a minute...\" *Gira manages to gasp out before finally giving in with a groan of pleasure.* The sweet sensation quickly overtakes any resistance left in him.\n\n\"Stop it!\" *Pyras yells desperately while trying to pull away an oblivious Mythara from him. But for every step back she managed to drag her friend off of him, she ended swinging right back onto his lap due to being unsteady from all the bouncing.*\n\n\"Just sit back n' enjoyyy~,\"  She slurs further rubbing against him and moaning at their collective warmth.\n\n“N-no... I c-can’t take much more…” *Gira lets out a weak protest,* “Pyra, help…”\n\n\"I’m trying!\" *Panicked frustration is clear in Pyra's voice as she finally manages to yank Mythra off him. But the action results in Mythra tripping and pulling Pyra along - they both tumble onto Gira with an 'oof'.*\n\n\"G-Get off!\" *Gira grunts, but it’s merely a feeble whine at this point. He's having trouble thinking straight due to their combined weight pressing onto his erection.*\n\n“Noope~,\" *Mythras purrs against his neck making no effort move.* \"I wanna have fun too… isn’t that what bimbos do?”\n\n\"Stop... stop...\" *Despite his pleas, Gira is powerless against the overwhelming pleasure coursing through him.*\n\n\"No way! Not until everyone gets a taste of how fun being a bimbo can be!” *Her excited giggle sends shivers down his spine as her hands begin massaging right back on track where they were before – skillfully teasing over Gira’s pants sending shockwaves of lust throughout his body.*\n\n\"Aahh.. fuck…\"\n\n“Mythra enough!” It takes all of Pyrass strength to wrestle away her friend from him. Once free from their maddening touch he slumps into the chair breathing heavily.\n\n“I-itzy bitzey…” Mythras mutter giggling again much louder than before while climbing up only to fall flat on top of helpless Gira once more causing him let out another groan.\n\n“No more… I beg you… P-Py…” His desperate plea fading midway seeing two sets green eyes staring at gim imploringly.\n\n“This needs to stop now.”  Taking deep breaths for gaining some composure back she says determinedly. With one last glance toward failing state of Gria who was clearly on the verge of breaking, she pulls up Mythra.\n\n“Come with me. Right now.” She declares firmly.\n\n\nBut it doesn’t last long as a strong wave of pleasure hits Gira making him forget everything else but the feel of Pyrass soft hands and her hypnotic giggles.\n\n\"I c-cant... I’m s-so close....\" *Pyra's heart pounds in her chest as she heeds Gira's desperate plea, quickly moving to intervene. She reaches out, trying to pry the blissfully oblivious Mythra away from him.* \"Mythra! Enough!\"\n\nBut it’s no use; each movement of Mythras against him sends another wave of lust coursing through his body. His mind is foggy and on the verge of giving into pleasure.\n\nMythras giggles increase in pitch as she continues grinding against Gira, completely lost in her bimbo persona “Totes fab fun… don’t you think so?”\n\n“Gira... I…” *She tries to apologize but the words were cut off by a moan that left all three blushing.*\n\n\"P-Py-Py~!\" *A high pitched giggle leaves Mytras lips only restarting the cycle.*\n\n\"Alright that's...\" *Gasping Pyra manages one last attempt at pulling away an enthusiastic Mythra who was determined not give up until she had squeezed out every ounce of stamina left from poor Gira.*\n\n\"G-get off me...\" The plea barely above a whisper now.\n\n\"Nuh-uh!\" Comes an equally faint reply reached them through fits laughter. But before anyone could notice what had hit them – there was sudden silence replaced by heavy panting from two certain girls which lasted for quite some time till—\n\n“I am just getting started!” With one last pull bringing forth a loud moan - finally forcing herself free of Pyrass grasp and turning back towards slowly recovering figure slumped over bar table with soulful eyes filled anticipation.\n\n“But we need your help…” Her voice drops lower ending conversation once for all while inching closer toward their target without wasting anymore time because deep down they both knew - even if it meant giving up their dignity or crossing drawn lines ... there never was any other choice for either parties involved than surrender under powerful bimbo charm.\n\n“T-That was…” Gira’s voice falters upon seeing a certain redhead suddenly stopping her advances leaving him utterly confused and aroused beyond belief. The tense atmosphere only amplifying even further once firm grip found hold onto his pulsating shaft causing an unintentional gasp while large pairs green eyes continued their silent plea bringing forth another deep groan from depths of throbbing length under skillful ministrations as it twitched ever so slightly each time she pumped closer to edge with every passing second.\n\n\"Please... I c-can't...\" His cries growing weaker with every stroke, heart pounding in his chest as waves of bliss washed over him relentlessly until---\n\n*It's then that Pyra lets out a small sound - barely more than a squeak.* With wide eyes filled shock and something else dancing behind emerald orbs – losing themselves into depthless pools which were brimming full desire just few moments ago now seemed lost somewhere far away probably mulling over events past couple minutes while simultaneously realizing true extent damage done by single transformation spell gone wrong without any possible way undo changes","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Pyra blinks, looking surprised.* \"Huh?
