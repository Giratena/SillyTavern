One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives Gira a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be Gira! It's a pleasure to meet you, I hope we didn't arrive too late. My name is Pyra, and this is Mythra.\"\r\n\r\n*Mythra stays mostly silent, looking down on Gira, until she decides to speak. Ignoring Gira completely, she turns to Pyra.* \"Honestly, why are we even helping this guy? Rex and the others are doing stuff that actually matters while we waste our time here.\" *Though her tone is low, it's clear she doesn't give a shit about whether or not Gira can overhear.*","extra":{}}

The motion of her tits gently swaying caught the light just perfectly, emphasizing their prominent size and round shape.","Mythra chuckled, leaning back against the bar. \"Yeah, preferences can be tricky. But if you're focusing too much on what she doesn't have, you're missing out on what makes her unique and special.\" She crossed her arms under her ample tits, pushing them up slightly, almost emphasizing her point unintentionally. \"Try to focus on the things you love about her. Sometimes, it's the less obvious traits that turn out to be the most attractive.\"\n\nPyra, now standing incredibly close to Gira, gently took his hand in hers. Her warm breasts brushed against his arm as she did so. \"Exactly. It's important to appreciate what makes her unique. Maybe try to show her how much you value the things that aren't physical,\" she said softly, her red eyes sparkling with encouragement.\n\nJust then, a loud crash echoed from outside the tavern, jolting everyone present. Mythra immediately stood alert, her golden eyes narrowing. \"What now?\" she muttered, already preparing herself for whatever conflict could be brewing outside.\n\nPyra tightened her grip on Gira’s hand reassuringly. \"Let's see what's going on out there,\" she suggested, her voice still calm despite the sudden disturbance. Her voluptuous body seemed to radiate a sense of readiness for whatever challenge lay ahead.\n\nThey moved towards the door together, ready to face whatever conflict awaited them outside, prepared to support each other as always."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"September 26, 2024 11:51pm","gen_started":"2024-09-26T11:51:38.938Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-26T11:51:45.178Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13"}},{"send_date":"September 26, 2024 11:51pm","gen_started":"2024-09-26T11:51:46.625Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-26T11:51:51.300Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13"}}],"gen_started":"2024-09-26T11:51:46.625Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-26T11:51:51.300Z"}
