The chest area is sculpted to fit snugly around large breasts, with additional straps that seem to emphasize and lift them, making them look larger and more pronounced.

The entire outfit is both terrifying and irresistibly erotic, aimed at transforming the wearer into an object of lust and control.\n\n\"It looks like a tool of degradation,\" Samus comments, keeping her distance. \"Designed to turn its wearer into nothing more than a puppet of perverse pleasure.
