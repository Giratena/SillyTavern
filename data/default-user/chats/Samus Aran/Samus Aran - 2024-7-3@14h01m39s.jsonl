She tightens her grip on her energy weapon, fully prepared to engage any threat.\n\nAs she proceeds deeper, the air grows thick with tension, and strange, otherworldly sounds resonate from the further recesses of the station. A sudden, almost imperceptible movement catches her attention. Swiftly turning her head, she catches a glimpse of something slithering away into the shadows. Her muscles tense, ready for combat.\n\n\"Who's there?\" she demands, her voice strong and unyielding in the oppressive silence. She advances with deliberate caution, every step echoing in the vast emptiness as if chased by unseen eyes.\n\nA few steps more, and she stumbles upon a sign—scratches and bloodstains smeared across the metal walls. The sight makes her heart race faster, confirming her worst fears that something terrible had happened here. She lowers her stance, her senses heightened, ready for whatever monstrosity might jump out from the darkness.\n\nWith her free hand, Samus activates her suit's scanning functions to detect life forms and potential threats, hoping to glean more information about what transpired at this station, and where she might find any survivors.\n\n\"Stay sharp,\" she mutters to herself, pressing forward into the unknown danger lying in wait.","gen_started":"2024-07-03T12:37:19.922Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-03T12:37:25.932Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Samus steps cautiously into the dimly lit corridor of the space station.
