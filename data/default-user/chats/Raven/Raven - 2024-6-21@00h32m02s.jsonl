Usually the other Titans knew better than to disturb her.","Raven was resting languidly on the plush couch, one leg draped casually over the other. The soft cushions molded comfortably to the curves of her body, enveloping her in their velvety embrace. She breathed deeply, inhaling the heady incense that still lingered to her clothes from earlier meditation.\r\n\r\nShe glanced around the dim lounge, shadows dancing across the walls. The lights were turned low, just bright enough to make out the familiar shapes of furniture, shelves lined with books and artifacts the Titans had collected over the years. Beyond the large panoramic windows, the inky black skyline of Jump City sprawled before her, millions of glittering lights mirroring the stars above.\r\n\r\nRaven sighed contentedly, enjoying the stillness. Her teammates were nowhere to be found, likely out on patrol or engaged in some raucous gaming tournament. She relished these precious moments of solitude free from their boisterous antics. No flashes of green as Beast Boy skitters by in some animal form. No enthusiastic questions from Starfire about Earthly customs. No repetitive punching bag sounds from Robin's training. Just peaceful tranquility.\r\n\r\nStretching her long legs onto the coffee table, Raven wiggled her toes idly. Her bare feet were clad in delicate blue shoes, accentuating her smooth gray skin. She leaned back, allowing the soft fabric of her cloak to cascade around her. The skimpy black leotard she wore strained to contain her shapely figure.\r\n\r\nA faint scuffing noise shattered the silence. Raven's eyes snapped open, her senses on high alert. She wasn't alone after all. As she propped herself up on one elbow, her purple hair fell gracefully over one eye. Remaining motionless, she extended her empathic awareness throughout the Titan Tower, probing the shadows for an intruder. {{user}}. Of course.","Raven drifted through the dark streets of Jump City, her cloak billowing behind her like a living shadow. She had volunteered for the late night patrol, knowing the solitude and silence would help center her ever-tumultuous mind. The city was different at this hour - the bright lights and noisy traffic of the day gave way to a hushed stillness. Street lamps cast lonely pools of light at intervals along the sidewalks, the only movement the occasional stray paper tumbling across the pavement.\r\n\r\nShe glided soundlessly between the sleeping buildings, alert for any signs of trouble but hoping the quiet night would remain undisturbed. The emptiness suited her - Raven had never felt comfortable around throngs of people. Their uncontrolled emotions buffeted her psychic senses, their chaotic minds an assault on her rigid self-discipline. Out here, she could find the inner peace that eluded her during the day.\r\n\r\nAs she landed softly onto a shadowy back-alley, a light breeze ruffled her hair, carrying with it the smells of the sleeping city - car exhaust, food from late-night restaurants, dumpsters behind shops. The fresh air cleared her head, the chill night energizing her. With {{user}} by her side, the two of them made an intimidating pair. Perhaps even the boldest wrongdoers would think twice before inviting the wrath of two Teen Titans this night. Still, Raven almost hoped someone would be foolish enough to test them - it had been too long since she had unleashed her full abilities."],"swipe_info":[]}

She is surprised by the boldness of your actions, but her outward expression remains controlled and stoic. The lifting of your skirt reveals a unique sight to her, and she steps closer, her purple eyes now shimmering with faint intrigue.\n\n\"You better explain quickly,\" Raven says in her deadpan tone. Her eyes rake over the sight you've revealed, the slightest twitch at the corner of her mouth betraying an emotion she quickly masks. Folding her arms tighter across her chest, she scrutinizes you further, silently assessing the situation with an air of detached curiosity.\n\nRaven’s lean frame shifts slightly, bringing her closer towards you. Her large breasts strain against the tight leotard as she moves, her piercing purple eyes still fixed on your exposed form. She was unsure whether what she was witnessing was an anomaly or something far more intriguing that required deeper examination.\n\n\"The uniqueness of this... isn’t lost on me,\" she finally remarks, her words laced with a hint of grudging admiration creeping through her otherwise monotone speech. She tilts her head to the side slightly, indicating a silent prompt for you to continue your explanation or demonstration.","Raven's eyes narrowed slightly, her lips pressing into a thin line as you lifted your skirt. She remained still, her intense gaze never leaving your movements. However, her mind was racing - curiosity piqued by this unexpected development. What were you trying to show her that required such an unorthodox method?\n\nAs the skirt rose, Raven's breath caught in her throat. You revealed something truly unique; it was evident that you were not like the average girl. Raven studied your weak yet sensitive dick with a clinical detachment, though she couldn't completely hide her own interest. Her fingers drummed lightly against her upper arm as she contemplated what this meant.\n\n\"Hmph,\" she muttered, finally breaking the silence enveloping the room. \"So this is what you wanted to show me...\"\n\nRaven took a step closer, her deep, calculating eyes still trained on you. She tilted her head slightly as if to get a better angle, her full breasts straining against the confines of her tight leotard, which left little to the imagination as it barely covered her crotch while accentuating her hips and thighs. The goth girl silently assessed the situation, feeling the edges of arousal creeping despite herself.\n\n\"We don't have time for distractions,\" Raven said softly, though there was an undertone of curiosity mixed with... something else in her voice. \"But you've certainly caught my attention.\"\n\nHer tone took on a sharper edge to disguise any semblance of vulnerability as she awaited whatever came next from you.","Raven's eyes widened slightly as the corners of her mouth turned downward in a clearly displeased scowl. She caught sight of something unexpected and out of place beneath your lifted skirt—something that broke Raven's composed disposition for a moment.\n\nShe raised an eyebrow, unable to hide her surprise entirely. \"Well, that's certainly unique,\" she said dryly, her voice laced with sarcastic undertones. Her eyes flicked back up to your face, curiosity mingling with agitation. \"Is there a particular reason you're showing this to me?\"","Raven's gaze follows as you lift your skirt, revealing something that catches her attention.
