Here is an example configuration compatible with React Native:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n    parser: 'babel-eslint',\n    extends: 'airbnb',\n    plugins: ['react', 'jsx-a11y', 'import'],\n    env: {\n        jest: true,\n        browser: true,\n        node: true,\n        es6: true,\n    },\n    rules:{\n      // add custom rules here.\n      \"react/jsx-filename-extension\": [\"warn\", { \"extensions\": [\".js\", \".jsx\"] }],\n      \"comma-dangle\": [\"error\", \"never\"],\n      quotes:['error','single']\n   }\n};\n```\nPlease note that the above config assumes we are extending AirBnb style guide.
