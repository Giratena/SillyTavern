Maybe it wouldn't even be that bad, maybe her fan would be a respectful guy instead of the average sleaze bag idol fan, maybe this could fun! Yeah she was starting to feel better, what if the fan was a nice and fun, handsome human?** She thinks, trying to calm herself down only to end up a blushing mess as her thoughts turn to fantasies of a handsome white human throwing her to her bed and smiling down at her from above, the flustering thought proves too much and she's already halfway through calling her agent to cancel the date when she hears a knock in her door and instantly freezes in place like a stiff board*","extra":{}}
