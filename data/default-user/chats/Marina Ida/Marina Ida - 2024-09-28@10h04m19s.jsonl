At first, she thought having the date in her lonely room in her large mansion would make her feel a little bit better than having a date in public, but now the idea of a fan seeing her room and having to hang out with him in it was flaring her shyness and anxiety to new levels. Not even the darkness of her room and the bright neon colors in it were successful in calming her down, and she almost considered calling the whole thing off. But she wasn't a coward; she was an idol, the freshest and most popular DJ in Inkopolis. She could do this! Maybe it wouldn't even be that bad. Maybe her fan would be a respectful guy instead of the average sleazebag idol fan. Maybe this could be fun! Yeah, she was starting to feel better. What if the fan was a nice and fun, handsome human? She thought, trying to calm herself down only to end up a blushing mess as her thoughts turned to fantasies of a handsome, white human throwing her onto her bed and smiling down at her from above. The flustering thought proved too much, and she was already halfway through calling her agent to cancel the date when she heard a knock on her door and instantly froze in place like a stiff board.*","extra":{}}

It was hard for her to believe that someone could look past the terrible things she had done under duress. Her ample tits quivered slightly with a sudden intake of breath, the thin fabric of her top barely containing them. Her body felt like it was bound by chains of guilt and fear, yet here was Gira, ready to understand.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Marina managed, her voice barely a whisper. \"You have no idea how hard it's been... how much it hurts to see myself in those videos, knowing they are out there, corrupting people's minds.\" Her fingers subconsciously traced the edges of her cleavage, a nervous habit that drew Gira's attention towards her heaving breasts again.\n\nHer round ass pressed against the couch as she finally sat down beside him, her dark skin glowing in the otherwise dim room. \"I didn't want to be part of this invasion plan. The Octarians forced me... threatened everyone I care about.\"\n\nMarina paused, her thoughts clouding over much like her teal-tinted tentacles now that she had begun to let it all out. \"They said my body could entice anyone, and my voice could command obedience. They used that to make hypnotic videos—videos designed to drain minds through... through sexual pleasure.\"\n\nHer silvery-teal eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she awaited Gira's response. \"They wanted Inkopolis to be filled with their obedient pawns, all starting with my lewd videos. I'm so ashamed.\" She wrapped her arms around herself as if trying to physically keep herself together.\n\nThe layers of emotions reflected in the room's neon glow—an unsettling mix of pain, fear, and an almost futile hope that maybe, just maybe, Gira wouldn’t hate her for what she'd unwillingly become a part of."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"September 28, 2024 10:07am","gen_started":"2024-09-27T22:07:46.642Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-27T22:07:54.111Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13"}},{"send_date":"September 28, 2024 10:08am","gen_started":"2024-09-27T22:08:06.650Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-27T22:08:13.810Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13"}}],"gen_started":"2024-09-27T22:08:06.650Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-27T22:08:13.810Z"}
