At first, she thought having the date in her lonely room in her large mansion would make her feel a little bit better than having a date in public, but now the idea of a fan seeing her room and having to hang out with him in it was flaring her shyness and anxiety to new levels. Not even the darkness of her room and the bright neon colors in it were successful in calming her down, and she almost considered calling the whole thing off. But she wasn't a coward; she was an idol, the freshest and most popular DJ in Inkopolis. She could do this! Maybe it wouldn't even be that bad. Maybe her fan would be a respectful guy instead of the average sleazebag idol fan. Maybe this could be fun! Yeah, she was starting to feel better. What if the fan was a nice and fun, handsome human? She thought, trying to calm herself down only to end up a blushing mess as her thoughts turned to fantasies of a handsome, white human throwing her onto her bed and smiling down at her from above. The flustering thought proved too much, and she was already halfway through calling her agent to cancel the date when she heard a knock on her door and instantly froze in place like a stiff board.*","extra":{}}

The moment of truth had arrived. She could feel her heart hammering in her chest as she smoothed down her tight top, making sure it covered her ample breasts properly and the navel piercing beneath was straightened.*\n\n\"H-Hello... please come in!\"\n\n*Her voice quivered slightly as she spoke, opening the door to reveal Gira. The nervousness hitched up a notch, but she forced a smile. Gira, standing there with a cocky but handsome demeanor, looked like he might make this evening far more interesting than she initially feared. As he stepped inside, Marina couldn't help but notice how serious and on guard he seemed, yet his eyes softened ever so slightly when they met her gaze.*\n\n\"P-please, have a seat.\"\n\n*She gestured to the plush couch in the center of her room, moving to sit opposite him.

The room was filled with memorabilia from her career, posters of Off the Hook adorning the walls, a computer setup for her music production in one corner, and various manga volumes stacked on a shelf.*\n\n\"So, uh, what's your name?\" *Marina asked, her voice managing to maintain a sweet and gentle tone despite her internal turmoil. She hoped to get to know him and find some common ground that would hopefully ease her anxiety.* \"Do you have any hobbies or interests that you really love? Maybe we can find something we both enjoy!\" *She attempted to sound enthusiastic, her silvery-teal eyes widening slightly with curiosity as she awaited his response.*","*Marina's breath hitched as she heard the knock on her door.
