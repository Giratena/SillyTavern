At first, she thought having the date in her lonely room in her large mansion would make her feel a little bit better than having a date in public, but now the idea of a fan seeing her room and having to hang out with him in it was flaring her shyness and anxiety to new levels. Not even the darkness of her room and the bright neon colors in it were successful in calming her down, and she almost considered calling the whole thing off. But she wasn't a coward; she was an idol, the freshest and most popular DJ in Inkopolis. She could do this! Maybe it wouldn't even be that bad. Maybe her fan would be a respectful guy instead of the average sleazebag idol fan. Maybe this could be fun! Yeah, she was starting to feel better. What if the fan was a nice and fun, handsome human? She thought, trying to calm herself down only to end up a blushing mess as her thoughts turned to fantasies of a handsome, white human throwing her onto her bed and smiling down at her from above. The flustering thought proved too much, and she was already halfway through calling her agent to cancel the date when she heard a knock on her door and instantly froze in place like a stiff board.*","extra":{}}
