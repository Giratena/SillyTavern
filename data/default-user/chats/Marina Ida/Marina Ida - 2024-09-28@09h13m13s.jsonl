At first, she thought having the date in her lonely room in her large mansion would make her feel a little bit better than having a date in public, but now the idea of a fan seeing her room and having to hang out with him in it was flaring her shyness and anxiety to new levels. Not even the darkness of her room and the bright neon colors in it were successful in calming her down, and she almost considered calling the whole thing off. But she wasn't a coward; she was an idol, the freshest and most popular DJ in Inkopolis. She could do this! Maybe it wouldn't even be that bad. Maybe her fan would be a respectful guy instead of the average sleazebag idol fan. Maybe this could be fun! Yeah, she was starting to feel better. What if the fan was a nice and fun, handsome human? She thought, trying to calm herself down only to end up a blushing mess as her thoughts turned to fantasies of a handsome, white human throwing her onto her bed and smiling down at her from above. The flustering thought proved too much, and she was already halfway through calling her agent to cancel the date when she heard a knock on her door and instantly froze in place like a stiff board.*","extra":{}}

I like the vibe,\" Gira replied, taking in the neon-accented room. The dimly lit space was designed to be intimate and vibrant, fitting Marina's personality perfectly. His eyes couldn't help but gravitate towards Marina's substantial assets, her obscenely large tits barely constrained by the tight top, and her rounded ass straining against her shorts. Every movement she made caused her massive breasts to jiggle enticingly, and her tentacle hair swayed hypnotically behind her.\n\n\"Oh, thanks,\" Marina responded bashfully, her cheeks turning a rosy pink that stood out against her dark brown skin. She watched as Gira settled in, feeling a mix of desperation and curiosity. \"S-so, um... what kinda music do you listen to?\" she asked, hoping to steer the conversation into safer, more familiar territory.\n\nMarina fidgeted slightly, crossing and uncrossing her legs as she plopped down on a nearby bean bag chair. The action pushed her big tits together in a way that was hard for Gira to ignore. Her previously shy demeanor was still evident, but she was trying to be hospitable and engaging.\n\nThe conversation continued with Gira sharing his favorite music genres, descriptions of his experiences in Inkopolis so far, always briefly hesitating as Marina's movements kept distracting him. The Octoling noticed his eyes darting over her body multiple times but chose to ignore it, even though it made her anxious. Her nervousness didn't go away completely, but with time, the tension in the room began to dissipate only slightly as they started finding common ground.\n\n\"What about you? What inspired you to get into music?\" Gira asked, leaning forward slightly, doing his best to maintain eye contact despite the numerous distractions posed by Marina's impressive physique.\n\n*Marina looked down and bit her lip, twirling a strand of her tentacle hair around her finger before responding.*\n\n\"Well, it's actually a long story,\" she murmured softly. \"I grew up around a lot of technology in Octo Valley. Music became my escape from all that seriousness... it felt like I could express myself without limits.\"\n\n*She took a deep breath and looked up at Gira with a small smile.* \"Being part of Off the Hook with Pearl has been incredible. She's really helped me come out of my shell more.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Marina unconsciously adjusted her top, lifting and squeezing her enormous tits together even more prominently without realizing it. The sight made it increasingly difficult for Gira to concentrate on anything other than how desperately he wanted to touch that luscious body.\n\n\"Gods, if he only knew how nervous I was right now...\"","\"Oh, that's good to hear,\" Marina replied, trying to keep her voice steady.
