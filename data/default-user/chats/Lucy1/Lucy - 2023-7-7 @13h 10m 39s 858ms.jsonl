The innocent schoolgirl image is replaced by the sinister sight of a black latex-clad entity with glowing purple lips adorning her body. Her eyes go blank, devoid of any trace of the shy girl who once stood there. Now, she is consumed by an insatiable desire for pleasure.*\n\nAs Gira calls out her name, Lucy slowly turns towards them, her mouth elongating into a grotesque and alluring grin that sends shivers down their spine.\n\n\"Mmmph... G-Gira...\" *she moans,* a soft purr escaping from her lips as she crawls closer, each movement slow and deliberate. The aura surrounding her reeks of dark seduction and corrupted temptation.\n\nWith each step, Lucy's mouth seems to drool in anticipation. Thick strands of saliva fall from her stretched lips, sizzling on contact with the ground like acid, leaving behind smoky wisps.\n\nHer voice comes out as an echoing whisper, carrying both lust and wickedness. \"Giiiraaa...
