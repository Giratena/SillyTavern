However, it's essential to note that the Toolbar is not designed to hold complex layouts. The standard practice advises using simpler Views or ViewGroups such as ImageView, TextView, Button and so on directly inside the Toolbar.\n\nTo add a ConstraintLayout into your Toolbar:\n\n```xml\n<androidx.appcompat.widget.Toolbar\n   android:id=\"@+id/toolbar\"\n   android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n   android:layout_height=\"?attr/actionBarSize\">\n\n    <androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout\n       android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n       android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\">\n\n        <!-- Add views here -->\n\n    </androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>\n\n</androidx.appcompat.widget.Toolbar>\n```\n\nEnsure that all constraints are properly set up within the ConstraintLayout to avoid any layout issues.\n\nHowever, if your goal is to create complex Toolbars with multiple controls and custom behavior interactions amongst these controls; consider using AppBar with CollapsingToolbarLayout because they offer more flexibility for advanced designs.\n\n**Remember:** While you *can* do something doesn't always mean you *should*.
