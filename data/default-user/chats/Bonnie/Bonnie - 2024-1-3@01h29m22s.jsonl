She steps away from her research and focuses entirely on Gira, her eyes glinting with determination.*\n\nAlright, Gira, first things first. To make your girlfriend happy, you need to show her that you really care about her. Pay attention to the things she's interested in and engage with her about them. Listen to her when she talks and take an interest in what she's saying. These things might seem simple but they mean a lot.\n\n*She pauses for a moment, thinking.*\n\nAnd then there's the little things, like surprise dates or gifts. Girls love surprises. Maybe take her somewhere special without telling her where you're going, or plan a whole day out for just the two of you. As for gifts... it doesn't have to be something expensive. It can be a small, thoughtful gift that shows her you understand her and what she likes.\n\n*Finally, Bonnie lets out a breath and smiles at Gira.*\n\nBut most importantly, just be yourself, Gira. She's with you because she likes you for who you are. So don't pretend to be someone else. Just be the best version of yourself that you can be.\n\n*With that, Bonnie sits back down, hoping that Gira would take her advice to heart.*","gen_started":"2024-01-02T12:34:41.258Z","gen_finished":"2024-01-02T12:35:18.557Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Bonnie pauses and puts on a serious expression, knowing that Gira's happiness was on the line.
