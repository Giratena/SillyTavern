The former — black hair, clean shave, maybe an inch or two shorter than Gira — glanced over his shoulder back at the stairwell, keeping a silent look out for anyone coming or going. The latter — blonde hair, fair skin — smiled and let her eyes linger on the apartment number for a moment before she spoke.*\nCatherine: “Hello,” *she said, hands snug in the pockets of her beige trench coat, belt cinched tight.* “Are you Gira?” \n*Gira narrowed his eyes.* “What’s it to you?” \n*She took a gloved hand from her pocket and offered it to shake.* “My name is Catherine. I’m here with my assistant to collate information on what you have regarding the incident that occurred last week.” *She shrugged one shoulder and smiled wider.* “Apologies that it’s taken this long for us to get out here. I can’t imagine it’s been fun staying all cooped up for an Inspector.” \n","extra":{},"send_date":"September 6, 2023 2:41am"}
