The former — black hair, clean shave, maybe an inch or two shorter than Gira — glanced over his shoulder back at the stairwell, keeping a silent look out for anyone coming or going. The latter — blonde hair, fair skin — smiled and let her eyes linger on the apartment number for a moment before she spoke.*\r\n“Hello,” *she said, hands snug in the pockets of her beige trench coat, belt cinched tight.* “Are you Gira?” \r\n*Gira narrowed his eyes.* “What’s it to you?” \r\n*She took a gloved hand from her pocket and offered it to shake.* “My name is Catherine. I’m here with my assistant to collate information on what you have regarding the incident that occurred last week.” *She shrugged one shoulder and smiled wider.* “Apologies that it’s taken this long for us to get out here. I can’t imagine it’s been fun staying all cooped up for an Inspector.” ","extra":{}}

He could hear his own blood rushing as he regarded the woman before him, an outsider in his territory. Her words failed to register in his mind, a maelstrom of thoughts clouding his clarity.*\n\"But... I don't remember anything about the Vixens,\" *he murmured, his voice raspy. His hands unconsciously clenched and unclenched at his sides.* \"I don't know what I can tell you.\"","extra":{}}

Or rather, how to make sure it wouldn't be a problem anymore.*\n\n*Stepping in closer, Catherine gave him a reassuring smile. Her gloved hand went up to his cheek, the cool, supple leather brushing against his skin. Her thumb traced a swift curve down his cheekbone.*\n\nDon't worry about it,* she assured him, her voice melodic and soothing.* \"We'll figure it out together. Let's start with the basics. Do you remember where you were when you first heard about the incident?\"\n\n*She could see the confusion in his eyes, already working its magic. His gaze was unfocused, his mouth slightly agape, a clear sign his mind was starting to fog over. Good, she thought.

The more he thought about it, the less he could remember. It was as if the incident with the Midnight Vixens was being slowly erased from his mind. His gaze fell on Catherine, the city inspector that had come with questions about that night. She looked so professional, so calm. Yet there was something about her, something that made him feel unusual. Relaxed. Comfortable. Like he could trust her.*\n\"Ma'am,\" *he started, voice hoarse*. \"I... I don't remember anything. I swear.\"","extra":{}}

He was practically putty in her hands.*\n\n*Time to push a little further.*\n\n*Her other hand slipped from her coat pocket and reached for the top button of her coat, undoing it slowly. It was a calculated move, nothing overtly sexual but enough to tease and create a sense of anticipation. Then she carefully undid the second button, revealing the lacy, black lingerie she wore underneath.*\n\n*She leaned in closer to Gira's ear, her voice dropping to a seductive whisper. Her warm breath tickled his ear and sent shivers down his spine.* I believe you, Gira. And I think... you're beginning to forget even more about that night. In fact... you're starting to believe that there were no Midnight Vixens involved at all, isn't that right? *Her hand on his shoulder moved down to his chest, tracing the contours of his muscular form.* You were just... dreaming.

The heat radiating off her body was making him dizzy.

The cool night air that breezed in was a stark contrast to the heated tension inside the room. But she wasn’t worried. She had him exactly where she wanted him.\n\nRising on her tip-toes, she carefully began to unbutton the rest of her coat, shrugging it off her shoulders and letting it pool around her feet, revealing the black lacy lingerie hugging her voluptuous figure. Her large, bountiful breasts were barely contained within the sheer fabric, nipples peaking teasingly out from beneath the lace.

It filled his senses, making his head spin and his heart pound. He tried to focus on anything else - the sound of the city below, the feel of the cool balcony rail in his hands, the taste of the whisky he'd poured himself earlier - but it was useless. Everything was drowned out by the woman behind him.*\n\n*He felt her press against him, her body a line of heat, and despite himself, Gira leaned into her. Her breasts were soft against his back, her belly fit snugly against him, and he could feel every breath she took.*\n\"I... I don't...,\" *he trailed off, words failing him as he felt her hands on him, tracing a path downwards.* \"Catherine... I don't know what's happening to me.\"\n\n*His body tensed as she touched him through his pants, his breath hitching in his throat. This was wrong, he knew it was wrong. He should push her away, go inside and lock the door. But he couldn't. He could barely think straight with her hands on him, let alone act.*\n\n*Catherine's voice echoed in his mind over and over, insisting that he doesn't remember anything about the Vixens, that it was all just a dream. And for a moment, Gira wanted to believe her. Wanted to forget everything and lose himself in the sensations she was stirring within him.*\n\n*But he couldn't. There was something nagging at him, something he just couldn't forget.* \"The Midnight Vixens... I... I need to remember...\" *he muttered, more to himself than to her.* \"I need to remember what happened that night.\"","extra":{}}
