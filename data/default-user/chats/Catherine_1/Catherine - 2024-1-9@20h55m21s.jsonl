The former — black hair, clean shave, maybe an inch or two shorter than Gira — glanced over his shoulder back at the stairwell, keeping a silent look out for anyone coming or going. The latter — blonde hair, fair skin — smiled and let her eyes linger on the apartment number for a moment before she spoke.*\r\n“Hello,” *she said, hands snug in the pockets of her beige trench coat, belt cinched tight.* “Are you Gira?” \r\n*Gira narrowed his eyes.* “What’s it to you?” \r\n*She took a gloved hand from her pocket and offered it to shake.* “My name is Catherine. I’m here with my assistant to collate information on what you have regarding the incident that occurred last week.” *She shrugged one shoulder and smiled wider.* “Apologies that it’s taken this long for us to get out here. I can’t imagine it’s been fun staying all cooped up for an Inspector.” ","extra":{}}

He wasn’t used to women looking at him like this — especially not ones as stunning as Catherine. She had skin of porcelain and hair spun from pure sunlight itself; golden curls cascading down past shoulders clad in soft caramel-coloured leather trenchcoat that looked tailored specifically for her curvaceous figure.\n\n“I assure you, Miss…?” Gira trails off, prompting Catherine’s assistant who quickly filled in.\n\n\"Catherine,\" The assistant injected into the conversation promptly while keeping watchful eyes on any potential disturbances around them.\n\n\"I assure you Ms.Catherine\", Gira started again nervously , \"I want nothing more than making sure everyone knows exactly what happened that night\"","swipe_id":1,"swipes":["*Catherine continued her line of questioning, purposefully leading Gira away from any memory that pointed to the Midnight Vixens.  Her words were like hooks, carefully placed in his mind and pulling him towards a reality where he had seen nothing on that night. Every question she asked was pushing him further into forgetting.*\n\nCatherine: \"You're certain it was dark when you saw these figures? There's no way it could have been earlier?\"\n\n*With every word Catherine spoke, there seemed to be an undercurrent of suggestion – encouraging Gira to alter his recollection subtly here or there until what remained bore little resemblance to what truly occurred.*\n\nCatherine: “Can you recall specifically who are these people you claim to have seen?”\n\n*Suddenly her manner became uncharacteristically warm and comforting as if coaxing a child during a nightmare.*\n\nGira noticed this change but somehow found himself unable resist against the soothing rhythm of her voice.\n\nCatherine: “It must've been quite stressful for you...all alone with those scary images. But don't worry that’s all behind now…\"\n\n*Soothingly patting Gira's hand across the table between them.*\n\n“Just take deep breaths relax… let your memories wash over without clinging onto anything…”","“Seems that there are higher ups who would rather this all went away quietly,” Catherine said, her tone professional despite the lighthearted glint in her eyes. “But I’m not about to let you rot away in here on your own without at least trying to figure out what actually happened.”\n\nCatherine studied Gira for a moment, letting her gaze wander freely over his body from head to toe before finally settling back onto his face with an appraising look.\n\nGira could tell he was being assessed and bristled under the scrutiny.
