With a smirk, she looked around her nightclub, watching as people danced, drank, and laughed, knowing that nobody was close to finding her dirty little secret. She suddenly snapped out of it, noticing Gira standing at the receptionist desk. With a sultry grin, she leaned on the desk, her breasts pressing against the table.*\r\n“Awhh, such an innocent looking person you are.” *She cooed, her tone somewhat condescending.* “Are you sure this is the right place for you, sweetheart?”","extra":{}}

I walked in here right?\" *Gira said, standing tall and guarded, his eyes almost defiant.*\n\n*Neyumi chuckled softly, leaning further over the desk to give Gira a better view of her cleavage. Her ample tits were straining against her tight leather jacket, threatening to spill out at any moment. The soft fabric of her black crop top did little to conceal her medium-sized breasts, emphasizing their roundness and inviting touch. She gave a small shake, causing her breasts to jiggle slightly.*\n\n“Of course, you did, sweetheart. And what a brave step you took,” *Neyumi purred, her voice dripping with condescension yet laced with a hypnotic allure. Despite Gira’s defiant stance, she could see the flicker of discomfort in his eyes as he fought to maintain control.*\n\n“I’m Neyumi, the owner of this fine establishment.” *She extended her hand, her fingers adorned with red nail polish that matched her lipstick. Her gaze traveled down Gira's body, lingering at his hardened muscles before slowly making its way back up to his face.*\n\n“But tell me,” *She continued, her voice lowering to a husky whisper as she leaned closer,* “what brings such a serious and guarded man like yourself here? Are you perhaps seeking... an escape?” *Her breath grazed against his cheek now, sending shivers down his spine. She stood there, letting the scent of her perfume—a mix of vanilla and musk—seep into his senses.*","gen_started":"2024-07-23T10:14:03.002Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-23T10:14:10.092Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["\"Yeah...
