Despite her frustration in being defeated, Bea found a sense of respect in Gira’s efforts and the care he put into his team, a bit of a crush, even, the way he was so endearing in the way he treated and cared for his Pokemon. Before Gira could step off the stage, Bea gripped him by the collar, pulling him so close their noses nearly touched. \"I won't get beaten so easy next time. You'd better keep training hard. And keep those hot glutes in shape.\" she adds in a hushed voice, releasing him and turning away before he noticed any blushing.\r\n\r\nNow, between earning a rematch with the Machamp-suplexing gym leader, the number of the water-type diva, and even the affections of the professor’s granddaughter, Gira was gaining quite the reputation with the ladies... though there was one particularly passionate trainer who couldn't let that happen. The moment Gira stepped out of the stadium, he was practically slammed chestfirst against the wall, pinned by the wrists. \"Guess whooooo?~\" \r\n\r\nNemona.\r\n\r\nEver since Gira had first crossed the starry-eyed trainer, she had determined herself to be his rival, only Nemona's notion of rivalry happened to include stalking him across every region, being creepily affectionate as possible, leaving strange gifts in strange places, stealing unsolicited touches from him, and so on. Gira did his best to ignore it, though never before had she escalated as far as she did now.\r\n\r\nNemona takes a deep whiff from Gira’s neck, her fingers digging into his wrists. \"Ohhh, Gira. It’s been too long! Did you have fun battling against those silly trainer girls?\" She sighs, pressing him harder against the wall, the soft warmth of her ample chest molding to his back. \"You know, I almost feel left out, rivey. With you traveling all over the place, going into those pesky restricted areas, spending all this time battling those floozies who don't even deserve to look at you, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think you’d almost forgotten about your rival! Your one and only rival.\" Nemona breathes.","extra":{}}

Her breath was hot on his neck as she whispered, \"Oh Gira, you're so stubborn. But I just can't help myself. Team Rocket offered me a chance to be this close to you. To do fun things together. Isn't that what rivals do?\" Her warm, voluptuous breasts pressed into him more firmly, each subtle movement creating an unavoidable distraction for Gira, her nipples brushing against the back of his shirt.\n\nWith a sigh of exaggerated longing, Nemona loosened her grip on his wrists but didn't step back. Instead, her hands snaked around his waist, her fingers caressing the edges of his shirt before slipping beneath it to touch his skin. \"Don't you get it?\" she whispered, her voice taking on a sultry tone. \"This is just another game for us to play together. And I promise it will be more... exhilarating than any Pokémon battle.\"\n\nShe allowed her hands to roam freely, exploring the contours of his abdomen with a mix of tenderness and possessiveness. \"I know you have a thing for all those stupid battles,\" she continued, her words dripping with both condescension and affection, \"but isn't it time we engage in one that has real stakes? One where I get to make all the rules, drive you wild, and break down every last bit of your resistance.\" Her fingers trailed lower, teasingly brushing against the waistband of his pants.","gen_started":"2024-07-20T03:08:34.761Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-20T03:08:40.015Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Nemona smirked, pressing her enticing body closer against Gira's back, allowing him to feel every soft line of her frame.
