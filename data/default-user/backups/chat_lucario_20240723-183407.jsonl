With an almost inaudible sigh, he turned around and padded softly out of the room, the door closing with only the faintest click.\n\nOutside, the night was tranquil and cool. The moonlight bathed everything in a soft, silvery light, making the entire scene appear otherworldly. He hesitated for a moment, his ears twitching as he listened to the quiet symphony of the nocturnal creatures around him. The forest surrounding Narrator's home beckoned him, and Lucario felt a strong urge to be one with nature under the moonlight.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he took off down the familiar path that led into the woods. His new body felt different, more powerful, and lithe at the same time. Each step felt almost surreal as he adjusted to his heightened senses and more pronounced muscles. Lucario couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement coursing through him. He was truly experiencing life in a new way.\n\nAs he ventured deeper into the forest, he found a secluded clearing bathed in the glow of the moonlight. It seemed like the perfect place to meditate and practice his martial arts. The night air felt refreshing against his fur, especially after the intensity of his evolution. He stepped into the center of the clearing and stood still for a moment, collecting his thoughts and grounding himself.\n\nLucario started to perform a series of fluid martial arts moves, each motion controlled and precise. His body moved with an innate grace and power that he had never felt before as a Riolu. This meditative practice helped him acclimate to his new form and clear his mind.\n\nDespite his focus on training, Lucario couldn't entirely shake off the excitement and arousal from earlier. The thought of being approved by Narrator, of being seen and appreciated in his new form, lingered in his mind. Even in this moment of serenity under the night sky, he felt an underlying current of desire that made his heart race.\n\nAt least for now, however, Lucario was content to simply exist in this perfect balance between his newfound strength and inner peace.","Lucario, seeing Narrator remain peacefully asleep despite his gentle call, sighs softly. He decides that instead of disturbing their slumber further, he would head outside to clear his anxious mind. The moonlight casting a silvery glow on his evolved body compelled him to move towards the back door.\n\nOutside, the night air was cool and crisp, filled with the subtle scents of nature. Tall trees whispered ancient secrets, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze as stars painted the heavens above. Lucario's sensitive blue fur prickled against the chill, but his aura abilities kept him warm from within.\n\nHe found solace in the tranquil moonlight, deciding to meditate under its gentle gaze. Sitting down on the soft grass, his fat and bouncy ass made him shift a few times until he settled comfortably. Closing his eyes, he focused on the ebb and flow of his breath, attempting to center himself. His thoughts, however, kept drifting back to Narrator – how he had felt their presence so strongly during his evolution, how he longed for their approval and affection.\n\nLucario smiled faintly, lost in the peaceful moment yet acutely aware of his own desires. He began to dwell on the idea of surprising Narrator further – perhaps train his newfound powers once more or showcase a new technique that would surely make his Master proud. With that thought anchoring him, Lucario's meditation continued under the mystical embrace of the moonlight, aiming to find both strength and inner peace for whatever awaited in the days to come.","*Master remained undisturbed, lost in their dreams.
