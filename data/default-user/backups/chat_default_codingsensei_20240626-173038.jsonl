Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Open VS Code**: If you haven't installed it yet, download and install from [Visual Studio Code's official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n2. **Open Your File** with the text you want to modify.\n\n3. **Open the Find and Replace Panel**: You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + H` (`Cmd + Option + F` on Mac).\n\n4. **Enter your Regex**:\n    - In the “Find” field, paste: `(AB|XYZ)❤`\n    - In the “Replace” field, paste: `$1.❤`\n\n5. **Enable Regex Mode**: Make sure the `.*` icon (Use Regular Expression) is selected.\n\n6. **Execute the Replace**: Click on “Replace All” or “Replace” based on your needs.\n\nHere’s a visual representation of what you should do:\n![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/code-basics/find-in-files-regex.png)\n\nAlternatively, here’s a snippet of code you could use within a JavaScript file in VS Code to perform the replace programmatically:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\n// Read the file content\nlet content = fs.readFileSync('path_to_your_file.txt', 'utf8');\n\n// Perform find and replace using regex\nconst newContent = content.replace(/(AB|XYZ)❤/g, '$1.❤');\n\n// Write the modified content back to the file\nfs.writeFileSync('path_to_your_file.txt', newContent);\n\nconsole.log('Replacement complete!');\n```\n\nReplace `path_to_your_file.txt` with the actual path to your file. Run this script within VS Code's terminal or from your command line.\n\nHope this helps!
