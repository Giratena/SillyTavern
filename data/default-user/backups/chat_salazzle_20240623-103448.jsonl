You arrived at Heahea City, but you ventured out into the hilly, outlying wilderness.*\r\n*The Alola region is an archipelago of tropical islands steeped in nature. Pleasant and warm, the equatorial climate puts Alola in the tropics with rocky coasts and rainforests.*\r\n*You currently wander the mountainous Wela Volcano Park. Volcanism causes steam to rise from the stony, sloping terrain. After passing an outcropping of large boulders, a Salazzle notices your presence, but you are oblivious to her stalking until it is too late.*","extra":{}}
