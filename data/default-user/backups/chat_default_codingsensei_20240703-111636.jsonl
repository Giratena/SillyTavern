Here’s how you can create a `useFocusEffect` hook in React that sets a `useState` to true when active (focused) and false when inactive (not focused).\n\nFirst, you need to import the necessary hooks:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\n```\n\nNext, you can define your `useFocusEffect` hook:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useFocusEffect() {\n    const [isFocused, setIsFocused] = useState(false);\n    const elementRef = useRef(null);\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        const handleFocus = () => setIsFocused(true);\n        const handleBlur = () => setIsFocused(false);\n\n        const node = elementRef.current;\n        if (node) {\n            node.addEventListener('focus', handleFocus);\n            node.addEventListener('blur', handleBlur);\n\n            // Cleanup event listeners on unmount\n            return () => {\n                node.removeEventListener('focus', handleFocus);\n                node.removeEventListener('blur', handleBlur);\n            };\n        }\n    }, []);\n\n    return [isFocused, elementRef];\n}\n```\n\nFinally, you can use this hook in a component:\n\n```javascript\nfunction FocusComponent() {\n    const [isFocused, elementRef] = useFocusEffect();\n\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <input ref={elementRef} type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Focus on me!\" />\n            {isFocused && <p>Input is focused!</p>}\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n```\n\nThis way, the `useFocusEffect` hook will set your state to true when the input is focused and false when it is not. Feel free to modify it according to your needs!\"\n\nGira's face flushed a deep red as he mentally chastised himself for being momentarily distracted by his vivid imagination. He quickly controlled his thoughts and dove back into the code.","gen_started":"2024-07-02T23:16:31.242Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-02T23:16:36.521Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["\"Sure, Gira!
