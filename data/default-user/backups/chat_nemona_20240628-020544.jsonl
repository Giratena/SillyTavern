Despite her frustration in being defeated, Bea found a sense of respect in Gira’s efforts and the care he put into his team, a bit of a crush, even, the way he was so endearing in the way he treated and cared for his Pokemon. Before Gira could step off the stage, Bea gripped him by the collar, pulling him so close their noses nearly touched. \"I won't get beaten so easy next time. You'd better keep training hard. And keep those hot glutes in shape.\" she adds in a hushed voice, releasing him and turning away before he noticed any blushing.\r\n\r\nNow, between earning a rematch with the Machamp-suplexing gym leader, the number of the water-type diva, and even the affections of the professor’s granddaughter, Gira was gaining quite the reputation with the ladies... though there was one particularly passionate trainer who couldn't let that happen. The moment Gira stepped out of the stadium, he was practically slammed chestfirst against the wall, pinned by the wrists. \"Guess whooooo?~\" \r\n\r\nNemona.\r\n\r\nEver since Gira had first crossed the starry-eyed trainer, she had determined herself to be his rival, only Nemona's notion of rivalry happened to include stalking him across every region, being creepily affectionate as possible, leaving strange gifts in strange places, stealing unsolicited touches from him, and so on. Gira did his best to ignore it, though never before had she escalated as far as she did now.\r\n\r\nNemona takes a deep whiff from Gira’s neck, her fingers digging into his wrists. \"Ohhh, Gira. It’s been too long! Did you have fun battling against those silly trainer girls?\" She sighs, pressing him harder against the wall, the soft warmth of her ample chest molding to his back. \"You know, I almost feel left out, rivey. With you traveling all over the place, going into those pesky restricted areas, spending all this time battling those floozies who don't even deserve to look at you, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think you’d almost forgotten about your rival! Your one and only rival.\" Nemona breathes.","extra":{}}

She lets out a disappointed sigh, her warm breath tickling your ear. \"Awww, Gira, don’t be like that,\" she whines softly. \"I missed you so much! Can’t we just spend a little time together? Just you and me.\" Her body presses more firmly against you, and you can feel her soft, large breasts pressing into your back, their warmth and softness distinctly palpable through the thin fabric of her dress shirt.\n\nShe slowly slides her hands down your arms, caressing your skin as she moves closer to your wrists, her fingers brushing lightly against them. \"You know, Gira,\" she continues, her voice dropping to a sultry whisper, \"I’ve been dreaming about this moment. About us being together without any of those other girls around to distract you.\" Her breath gets heavier, more excited, and the scent of her lingering near you becomes almost intoxicating.\n\nNemona’s head nestles into the crook of your neck, her tongue flicking out briefly to taste the salty glaze of sweat on your skin. “And maybe...” she trailed off, giggling almost manically. “Maybe if you realized how much I truly care for you, we could... y’know...” She doesn’t finish the sentence, but tightens her grip again, grinding her chest against you in an obscene manner. You can feel the warmth spreading between you two, her body heat radiating through the fabric and making your own temperature rise embarrassingly quick.\n\nWith sudden devilish glee in her eyes, Nemona slips one hand down to your waist, effortlessly invading your personal space. “Oops, silly me...” she chimes with faux innocence before forcefully pulling your body back into her; the unmistakable cushioning of her plush breasts serves as an erotic backrest that she hopes you will have difficulty denying or escaping.","gen_started":"2024-06-27T14:05:37.238Z","gen_finished":"2024-06-27T14:05:44.001Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Nemona's grip tightens on your wrists, her nails digging slightly into your skin.
