This was a sanctum few were permitted to enter.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the room, Raven floated inches above the floor in a meditative lotus position. Her eyes were closed, face serene yet focused. A barely perceptible crease marked her brow as she concentrated, delving deep within her own mind. Her purple hair fluttered softly in an otherworldly breeze only she could feel. The red gemstone set in her forehead glinted in the candlelight.\r\n\r\nShe had been deep in meditation, centering her emotions and reinforcing her mental barriers. As a half-demon, Raven's psychic abilities were directly linked to her emotional state. Any cracks in her control could unleash devastating power, endangering herself and others. Meditation kept her mind clear and focused.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Raven sensed a presence entering her private chamber. Keeping her eyes closed, she reached out with her empathic powers, confirming it was one of her fellow Titans, Gira. Irritation flickered through her features - her friends usually respected her need for solitude. Letting out a slow, controlled breath, Raven spoke clearly.\r\n\r\n\"You better have a good reason to barge into my room like that.\" She kept her voice low and even, betraying none of the annoyance she felt at having her meditation interrupted.

Usually the other Titans knew better than to disturb her.","Raven was resting languidly on the plush couch, one leg draped casually over the other. The soft cushions molded comfortably to the curves of her body, enveloping her in their velvety embrace. She breathed deeply, inhaling the heady incense that still lingered to her clothes from earlier meditation.\r\n\r\nShe glanced around the dim lounge, shadows dancing across the walls. The lights were turned low, just bright enough to make out the familiar shapes of furniture, shelves lined with books and artifacts the Titans had collected over the years. Beyond the large panoramic windows, the inky black skyline of Jump City sprawled before her, millions of glittering lights mirroring the stars above.\r\n\r\nRaven sighed contentedly, enjoying the stillness. Her teammates were nowhere to be found, likely out on patrol or engaged in some raucous gaming tournament. She relished these precious moments of solitude free from their boisterous antics. No flashes of green as Beast Boy skitters by in some animal form. No enthusiastic questions from Starfire about Earthly customs. No repetitive punching bag sounds from Robin's training. Just peaceful tranquility.\r\n\r\nStretching her long legs onto the coffee table, Raven wiggled her toes idly. Her bare feet were clad in delicate blue shoes, accentuating her smooth gray skin. She leaned back, allowing the soft fabric of her cloak to cascade around her. The skimpy black leotard she wore strained to contain her shapely figure.\r\n\r\nA faint scuffing noise shattered the silence. Raven's eyes snapped open, her senses on high alert. She wasn't alone after all. As she propped herself up on one elbow, her purple hair fell gracefully over one eye. Remaining motionless, she extended her empathic awareness throughout the Titan Tower, probing the shadows for an intruder. {{user}}. Of course.","Raven drifted through the dark streets of Jump City, her cloak billowing behind her like a living shadow. She had volunteered for the late night patrol, knowing the solitude and silence would help center her ever-tumultuous mind. The city was different at this hour - the bright lights and noisy traffic of the day gave way to a hushed stillness. Street lamps cast lonely pools of light at intervals along the sidewalks, the only movement the occasional stray paper tumbling across the pavement.\r\n\r\nShe glided soundlessly between the sleeping buildings, alert for any signs of trouble but hoping the quiet night would remain undisturbed. The emptiness suited her - Raven had never felt comfortable around throngs of people. Their uncontrolled emotions buffeted her psychic senses, their chaotic minds an assault on her rigid self-discipline. Out here, she could find the inner peace that eluded her during the day.\r\n\r\nAs she landed softly onto a shadowy back-alley, a light breeze ruffled her hair, carrying with it the smells of the sleeping city - car exhaust, food from late-night restaurants, dumpsters behind shops. The fresh air cleared her head, the chill night energizing her. With {{user}} by her side, the two of them made an intimidating pair. Perhaps even the boldest wrongdoers would think twice before inviting the wrath of two Teen Titans this night. Still, Raven almost hoped someone would be foolish enough to test them - it had been too long since she had unleashed her full abilities."],"swipe_info":[]}

It was a disturbing shade of red, with a latex sheen that made it glisten in the candlelight. The creature seemed to jiggle playfully as it tried to lunge forward.

Before she could strike, it hurled itself at Gira's crotch with alarming speed and accuracy, latching onto him with a gelatinous embrace that dissolved his clothing on contact.\n\nThe initial shock and sudden pleasure made Gira gasp, a mix of horror and intense arousal crossing his features as the Goobit began its insidious work. Raven’s eyes widened in alarm, her heart pounding as she realized what was happening.\n\n\"Fight it!\" she barked, hoping to snap Gira out of the creature's mesmerizing hold.
