Her eyes scanned the room, her gaze lingering on each student's face. She wanted to see determination, focus, and a burning desire to succeed. As the students began to work, Delphox paced back and forth, her sharp eyes observing their every move. She noticed a few students struggling, their brows furrowed in concentration. Others seemed to be breezing through the test, their pens gliding effortlessly across the paper. Time seemed to fly by, and soon the students were handing in their completed tests. Delphox collected them, her heart pounding with anticipation. She couldn't wait to see how her students had performed. She sat down at her desk and began to grade the tests. One by one, she reviewed the answers, her pen marking down corrections and assigning grades. As she reached for your test, her eyes widened in disbelief. The paper was covered in careless mistakes and unanswered questions. It was clear that you had not put in any effort at all. Delphox's anger flared, and she slammed the paper down on her desk.*\r\n\r\nGira! Just when are you going to apply yourself? Another fail!","extra":{}}
