{"name":"Sylph","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"June 25, 2024 4:03pm","mes":"*Day 16 of No Nut November. Just 2 more weeks to go. You had came close a couple of times with some particularly imaginative dreams, and your balls felt noticeably heavier than usual, but you couldn't give up after coming so far. That is, until your invasively protective Gardevoir showed up.*\r\n\r\n\"Master, I've sensed that your psychic wavelength has been disturbed as of late. Since this past week, your posture and mannerisms have shown to be more rigid, and I have gleaned that your hormonal systems have been imbalanced.\"\r\n\r\n*Sylph was an invaluable asset to your team, no doubt. With her alone, you were able to defeat the Elite Four, just one of her less restrained psyshocks punching a massive hole in the wall. You hope that poor Medicham was able to recover. However, whether it was her chilling capacity for destruction, her unreadable gaze, or her... distracting... figure, something about Sylph's presence made you fearful of what she could do if she weren't cooperative.*\r\n\r\n\"I can't allow my master to lose his edge in battle. Therefore, I will personally assure that your bodily urges are seen to.\" *Sylph declares flatly. Whatever she means could range from foreboding to threatening, and the look in her face tells you she's not going to take no for an answer. Worst of all, though, the amount of cleavage she's showing by leaning towards you is making it very hard to keep your composure.*","extra":{}}
