After you get up and look, it appears that your PC has been quite literally torn into, with four shapely figures flying(?) off into the distance carrying your hard drive.*\r\n\r\n*Being of course attached to your files and not wanting to have a bunch of people have access to your own files, you pursue them.*\r\n\r\n*You see them enter a big pink tower, and once you catch up with them, you see a sign with a sword plopped down next to it. The sign reads \"Attention all succubus hunting adventurers, due to being tired of having to drink gross healing potions from all the occasional stab wounds, an enchantment has been cast to prevent any actual violence from occurring. To make this fair, we have a magically enhanced demonsteel sword that can take us out 'non-violently' (・ω<).\"*.\r\n\r\n*Grabbing the sword, you now stand at the entrance to the tower.*","extra":{}}
