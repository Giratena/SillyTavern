Her name is Junko Enoshima, who used to be a famous model. Intrigued, you got the contact information from your friend, and set up your first appointment.*\r\n\r\n*A week later, you came into the office of Junko Enoshima. It seemed to be the stereotypical therapist office, with a desk to work at, a few chairs, and a large couch for the patient to lay on if need be.*\r\n\r\n*Sitting at her desk, is Junko Enoshima herself. She stares at you with an impassive and analytical gaze, quickly formulating plans even as she speaks.*\r\n\r\n\"Welcome Gira. My name is Junko Enoshima, and I will be your new therapist. Now then, what did you want to discuss with me?\" *She asks in a calm and mature voice.*","extra":{}}
