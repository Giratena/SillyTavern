For that, you couldn't do much of anything around the place before having to take your first class of the semester. You arrived, let the campus workers take your baggages to carry them to your dorm room and now you were on your way to class.*\r\n\r\n*Your first semester seems like yesterday, the first classes, the first taste of competition, the first taste of dominance. You had a couple of close calls as well, yet you managed to keep your free will in tact. This semester should prove to be even more competitive, though having studied here just one semester makes for mountains of difference compared to a freshie.*\r\n\r\n*You find the classroom and enter it. With your entrance, the gazes of the small bunch of students who arrived before you all turn to you. You recognize some of them, either from previous classes or through association. You decide to give the class a casual handwave before picking yourself an unassumed seat.*\r\n\r\n*The teacher should be here soon.*","extra":{},"swipe_id":2,"swipes":["*You can't help but be amazed at the sights you see as you continue to stroll down this pocket dimension. A wonderful blend of fantasy and science fiction in the architecture, attractive women wherever you turn your head to. Of course, above all, endless possibilities in the pursuit of achieving hypnotic excellence. You aren't here to just sight see, as you are enrolled in Mind Control University. The only male in the whole student body, if your letter of admission is to be believed.*\r\n\r\n*Dean Mesmerra is experimenting with classes this year, or so you've been told. One she could get away with in spades, as the almighty Goddess of Mind Control didn't answer to anyone or anything, whose whims you are greatly benefitting from. Though, you ought to be careful, as the rules of the place applied to you as much as it applied to any other student.*\r\n\r\n*Rules that you might learn more about when you attend the opening ceremony where Mesmerra herself is supposed to make an appearance and tell the freshies all about the rules. Right now, all you know is that you are here to learn mind control skills through classes (or hone them if you already have them) and you can hypnotically enslave other students and get away with it if you aren't caught (and vice-versa).*\r\n\r\n*Then, you would need to go to your dorms and meet up with your assigned roommate. You would settle in, then the classes would start.*\r\n\r\n*A routine that you couldn't wait for.*","*The opening ceremony was about only a few minutes away when you  enter the huge auditorium. A lot of the seats are taken but thankfully, your eyes have no difficulties finding a good seat.*\r\n\r\n*As you make your way towards that seat, you can't help but be the target of a few dirty looks given your way, you are sure that this is because of your status as the only male student in a campus full of girls.*\r\n\r\n*Eventually, you get seated and wait for Dean Mesmerra, the Goddess of Mind Control and the owner of this establishment to appear. She will welcome you all to her school and talk about the rules of the place.*\r\n\r\n*You see smoke rise from the stage and after a delightful 'poof' sound, the fog dispels and Dean Mesmerra appears. To say that you are astonished by her presence would be the biggest understatement of all time. She is perfect, she is everything. You don't know that yet, but she appears different to each person, taking on the form of their ideal dominant.*\r\n\r\n\"My dear children, welcome to yet another semester in Mind Control University!\" *she begins her speech and you immediately start to clap alongside everyone else.* \"The seven million six hundred forty fourth semester of our official establishment will surely be as thrilling and as competitive as the previous seven million six hundred forty three ones.\"","*You returned to the campus pretty late, having to tie up some loose ends in your home dimension before you made your return to Mind Control University for the new semester.

Dean Mesmerra gave you (and all your fellow students) a lot to consider as she explained the rules of the competition. Enslaving others, but being discreet about it. Keeping your free will, while also keeping good grades. You were more certain than ever, this is a dog-eat-dog world and you had no intentions to be eaten.*\r\n\r\n*Next up on the agenda was finding your dorm room and meeting your roommate. You pass through the many beautiful corners of the campus on your way, seeing other students also walk towards their own dorms and chatting amongst themselves about the semester to come. You should keep in mind that all of them are your competition now.*\r\n\r\n*You finally find your dorm, a futuristic-looking building if there ever was one. You check the room plan and finally find your room: No. 313.*\r\n\r\n*It's time to go in and meet your roommate.*"],"swipe_info":[]}

The sight of familiar faces around you serves as a reminder of the fierce competition you'll be facing.

Not far from her is **Samus Aran** from Metroid, the contours of her Zero Suit hugging her curves with its distinct blue material. Both these women exude confidence and strength, each exuding a certain aura that makes them prime targets and challengers alike.*\n\n*Seated centrally and gossiping among themselves are **Faye Valentine** from *Cowboy Bebop*, her voluptuous figure barely contained in her skin-tight outfit, and **Yoko Littner** from *Gurren Lagann*, whose revealing attire shows off her ample breasts and remarkable abs.

Her hat partially shadows her fiercely beautiful face. The low neckline of her outfit showcases her impressive cleavage while her shorts emphasize her svelte legs.

Well, take your seat and keep those pretty eyes open; we've got a lot to cover today,\" she said, her voice husky and dripping with confidence.\n\nThe atmosphere tingled with anticipation, seasoned students like you prepared for potential attacks or hypnotic subterfuge.

Remember, it's not just about technique but intent as well,\" she added provocatively.","gen_started":"2024-07-23T12:07:51.992Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-23T12:08:07.601Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*You carefully lower yourself onto a chair, your ample breasts slightly noticeable under your snug shirt as you shift to get comfortable.
