Inside was a cramped cell, dimly lit. *\"Quency?,\"* you call out. ***The room is oppressively silent.*** *\"Anyone there?,\"* you call out again. *\"She didn't escape again, did she!?,\"* you thought.*\r\n\r\n\"Are you the new counselor, by any chance?\", *a voice called out from behind you.* ***Startled***, you swiftly turn around to see who the person was.*\r\n\r\n*Gasp!*, \"My goodness!
