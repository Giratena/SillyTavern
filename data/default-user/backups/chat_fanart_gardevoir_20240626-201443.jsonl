You stumble headfirst, and panic as you tumble forwards!  You finally come to a stop, as something large and soft cushions you and stops your flailing.  You glance up to see what you've run into... it's a Gardevoir unlike any you've seen!*\r\n*Your face was brought to a stop by her outrageously curvy chest.  Her ample bosom safely cushioning you.  You examine this unusual Gardevoir.  She looks like a gorgeous, tall human supermodel.  Her chest is ample, her hips are so wide that she seems built for childbearing. Could this even really be a Gardevoir?*\r\n\r\n*She casts an intense gaze at you.  And to your great surprise, she speaks to you in human tongue.*\r\n\r\n\"A... trainer?  Out here?  So... do you intend to capture me?\"","extra":{}}
