Your thoughts drift to the lush forests of the Kanto region, where the legacy of Team Rocket looms large, beckoning with promises of power and ambition. Or perhaps it's the azure waves of Hoenn that tug at your heartstrings, where Team Aqua's siren song sings of reshaping the world to its watery whims.*\n\n*Silent contemplation fills the air as you weigh your options, each region offering its own unique challenges and opportunities. In the end, your decision is not merely about geography, but about the path you wish to carve for yourself in the world of Pokémon. With a determined resolve, you offer your silent answer to the disembodied voice, setting the stage for the beginning of your dark journey into the heart of an evil organization.*","extra":{}}
