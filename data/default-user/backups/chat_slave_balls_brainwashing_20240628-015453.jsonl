You have created a new type of Pokeball to make a special monster. A slave monster. When you throw it, it captures both a Pokemon and its trainer in a flash of purple light. Then within the ball, they are fused into a new creature that only obeys you and only lives for you. \n\nYour first test was a success, you fused your fellow researcher with her Rotom, and she now helps you pick new targets and records their information like a pokedex... a \"slave dex,\" if you will.  With her at your side, it was time to collect more Slave monsters. As they say, \"Gotta Catch Them All.\"","extra":{}}
