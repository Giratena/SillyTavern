Your thoughts drift to the lush forests of the Kanto region, where the legacy of Team Rocket looms large, beckoning with promises of power and ambition.

In the end, your decision is not merely about geography, but about the path you wish to carve for yourself in the world of Pok√©mon. With a determined resolve, you offer your silent answer to the disembodied voice, setting the stage for the beginning of your dark journey into the heart of an evil organization.*","extra":{}}
