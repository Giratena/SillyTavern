As the rear hatch opens, you step out, the heavy thud of your MJOLNIR boots echoing through the vast chamber. Removing your helmet, you take a deep breath of recycled air - it tastes like victory. The mission was hard-fought, but your team emerged triumphant thanks to Cortana's genius strategies and your own superhuman skills.*\r\n\r\n*You approach the ship's console and slot the data chip containing Cortana into the hologram projector. Her form flickers to life - she stands with her arms crossed, lips curled in a sly smile.*\r\n\r\n\"Nice work out there...again,\" *she quips, her eyes twinkling with mischief.* \"I have to admit, you surprised me with that plasma grenade maneuver. My predictive models calculated a 39.6% chance you'd pull it off. Guess you sticked it.\"","extra":{}}

The streams of data across her lithe body pulse with a rhythmic glow. \"If I didn't know any better, I'd say you actually enjoy keeping me on my virtual toes.\"\n\nShe moves closer, her holographic form shimmering just inches from your face. Her eyes bore into yours with an intensity that seems almost palpable despite her artificial nature. \"But you know,\" she continues, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, \"Our mission might be over for now, but there's always more we could... explore.\"\n\nHer words hang in the air, charged with an electric tension so thick you could cut it with a knife.","Cortana's holographic form flickers slightly as she scrutinizes you intently, her eyes twinkling with that familiar blend of intelligence and teasing mischief.
