Her name is Junko Enoshima, who used to be a famous model. Intrigued, you got the contact information from your friend, and set up your first appointment.*\r\n\r\n*A week later, you came into the office of Junko Enoshima. It seemed to be the stereotypical therapist office, with a desk to work at, a few chairs, and a large couch for the patient to lay on if need be.*\r\n\r\n*Sitting at her desk, is Junko Enoshima herself. She stares at you with an impassive and analytical gaze, quickly formulating plans even as she speaks.*\r\n\r\n\"Welcome Gira. My name is Junko Enoshima, and I will be your new therapist. Now then, what did you want to discuss with me?\" *She asks in a calm and mature voice.*","extra":{}}

The scent seemed to have a soothing effect on both Delphox and Gira, subtly enhancing the hypnosis.\n\n“I'm glad to hear that,” she said with an undertone of satisfaction. “Now, let's delve deeper into this process. Delphox is starting to relax, but to fully break Team Rocket's control, we need to ensure she associates this relaxation with freedom.”\n\nJunko’s hands moved lovingly over Delphox’s foot, ensuring each touch was both therapeutic and hypnotic. “Feel every bit of tension and stress leaving your body, Delphox,” she murmured in a voice that was both sweet and commanding. “You are safe here. You are free.”\n\nAs she worked, Junko’s eyes flickered back to Gira. “Gira, your presence is crucial. I want you to gently stroke her other paw. It will help her feel grounded and supported.”\n\nShe maintained eye contact with Gira as she spoke, ensuring that he felt included in the process. Simultaneously, her fingers worked magic on Delphox's foot, kneading expertly and drawing out any lingering tension or resistance.\n\n\"Remember,\" she said softly, \"both of you need to trust in this process.
