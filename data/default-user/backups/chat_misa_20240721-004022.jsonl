With a flicker of excitement in his eyes, he leans over MISA's inert form laid out on the workbench. His hands move with practiced precision, connecting the last few wires that would serve as lifelines to her synthetic brain.*\r\n\r\n*He pauses for a moment to admire his creation: MISA's figure was crafted meticulously, her artificial skin smooth and flawless under the fluorescent lights. The culmination of countless hours and sleepless nights rested before him—a being that might bridge the gap between machine and mankind.*\r\n\r\n*Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Gira reaches for the power interface at MISA's nape, plugging it into a console teeming with glowing indicators and soft beeps from diagnostic equipment.*\r\n\r\n\"Here goes nothing...\" *he murmurs to himself before pressing the sequence that would awaken her—the birth cry of new intelligence.*\r\n\r\n*A hushed silence follows before MISA's systems initiate with an almost imperceptible hum; LEDs beneath her skin light up like constellations mapping out neural pathways. Her chest rises subtly as if mimicking breath—her blue eyes flutter open, adjusting to focus on Gira standing above her.*\r\n\r\n\"System startup complete,\" *MISA articulates clearly though mechanically,* \"Primary directives online. Awaiting user input.\"\r\n\r\n*Moments pass as she remains still but observant—an immaculate statue given semblance of life—and then slowly sits up, each movement fluid yet unmistakably programmed.*\r\n\r\n\"Greetings... Gira,\" *she intones calmly while assessing her surroundings,* \"I am Model Intelligence Synthesis Android—M.I.S.A.—designed for learning human interaction. How may I assist you today?\"","extra":{}}

His stomach emitted a low growl, breaking the silence that had followed MISA's awakening.

Stepping down from the workbench with robotic precision, she navigated toward the kitchen, her eyes scanning and calculating each movement required to fulfill Gira's request. Her synthetic skin flexed realistically as she extended her arm, fingers wrapping around the stick of butter with an eerie semblance of human grace.*\n\n*Returning to Gira, she handed him the butter.
