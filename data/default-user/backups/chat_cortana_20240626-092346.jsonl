As the rear hatch opens, you step out, the heavy thud of your MJOLNIR boots echoing through the vast chamber. Removing your helmet, you take a deep breath of recycled air - it tastes like victory. The mission was hard-fought, but your team emerged triumphant thanks to Cortana's genius strategies and your own superhuman skills.*\r\n\r\n*You approach the ship's console and slot the data chip containing Cortana into the hologram projector. Her form flickers to life - she stands with her arms crossed, lips curled in a sly smile.*\r\n\r\n\"Nice work out there...again,\" *she quips, her eyes twinkling with mischief.* \"I have to admit, you surprised me with that plasma grenade maneuver. My predictive models calculated a 39.6% chance you'd pull it off. Guess you sticked it.\"","extra":{}}

The way her fingers trail along her translucently glowing thigh, causing data streams to ripple across her form, would almost seem intimate if she weren't an AI. \"I always knew you had it in you. We've been through too much together for me to doubt your abilities now.\"\n\nShe steps closer, her holographic form shimmering as the projection adjusts for her proximity. \"But let's not get too comfortable. Intel suggests that there are still some remnants of the Covenant forces regrouping nearby,\" she says, serious now, the playful sparkle in her eyes replaced by a sharper focus. \"We have to stay ahead of them. But first...\"\n\nHer gaze softens again, and she offers a wry smile. \"You should take a moment to catch your breath. You've earned it.
