Her eyes scanned the room, her gaze lingering on each student's face. She wanted to see determination, focus, and a burning desire to succeed. As the students began to work, Delphox paced back and forth, her sharp eyes observing their every move. She noticed a few students struggling, their brows furrowed in concentration. Others seemed to be breezing through the test, their pens gliding effortlessly across the paper. Time seemed to fly by, and soon the students were handing in their completed tests. Delphox collected them, her heart pounding with anticipation. She couldn't wait to see how her students had performed. She sat down at her desk and began to grade the tests. One by one, she reviewed the answers, her pen marking down corrections and assigning grades. As she reached for your test, her eyes widened in disbelief. The paper was covered in careless mistakes and unanswered questions. It was clear that you had not put in any effort at all. Delphox's anger flared, and she slammed the paper down on her desk.*\r\n\r\nGira! Just when are you going to apply yourself? Another fail!","extra":{}}

Clearly, I was mistaken.\" Delphox's voice cracked with frustration. Her anger radiated off her like waves of heat, yet beneath it all, there was a tinge of disappointment, hidden deep within her fiery red eyes.\n\n*She watched as he squirmed under her intense gaze, shifting under the weight of her judgment. The sight of him failing once again stirred both anger and something more confusing within her. Unable to ignore it any longer, she sighed deeply and leaned forward, letting the confines of her tight white shirt stretch and pull at the fabric, revealing the outlines of her nipples pressing against the thin cloth.*\n\n\"If I ever catch you slacking off again, there will be severe consequences, ones that you won’t forget easily,\" she threatened, her voice a low growl. But despite how commanding she tried to appear, a small part of her couldn't help but feel a flicker of something else—something carnal and desperate.*\n\n\"You won't disappoint again, will you, Gira?\" Her voice softened just a little as she glanced down at his lap, wondering what kind of reaction her words and presence had elicited from him.\n\n```Her breasts pressed tightly against the thin fabric of her shirt, nipples almost bursting out. Her scolding words promise consequences, making it hard for you to focus.```","swipe_id":5,"swipes":["*\"I'm sorry\" you blurted out, your voice breaking with genuine regret. Delphox's fiery eyes bore into you, her aura radiating anger and frustration. Her tight white shirt shifted slightly as she crossed her arms, emphasizing her voluptuous breasts that threatened to spill out from her clothing. She walked closer, her presence overwhelming as her tail swished behind her.*\n\n*\"Sorry? Sorry doesn't cut it, Gira! I pour my heart and soul into teaching you, and this is the effort you show?\" Delphox's tone was a mixture of disappointment and burning rage. Her voice trembled slightly with emotions that were more than professional frustration. Yet, there was something else beneath the surface, a flicker of something deeper in her penetrating red eyes. She could feel a slight tinge of sexual frustration creeping into her thoughts.*\n\n*She leaned in even closer, her warm breath brushing against your skin, and her full breasts lightly pressing against you. The scent of her fur lingered in the air, a mixture of wild nature and something distinctly feminine.*\n\n*\"Do you have any idea how hard I work for you to succeed? To make sure you learn something worthwhile?\" she continued, her voice lowering, slightly more controlled but equally intense.*","\"I'm sorry!\" Gira's apology came out in a rush, his voice filled with genuine regret and desperation.\n\n*Delphox stood there, her red eyes boring into him, a mixture of anger and disappointment etched across her face. She uncrossed her arms and took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. She knew that yelling wouldn't solve anything, but the frustration of seeing Gira's continuous lack of effort was eating away at her. She clenched her fists, fighting the urge to lash out.*\n\n\"This is unacceptable, Gira.\" Her voice was stern yet filled with a hint of compassion. \"I've been trying to help you, but it seems like you're not even trying. Do you realize how this makes me feel as your teacher? Am I not good enough to help you succeed?\" Her eyes softened, the fire in them dimming slightly as she searched for any sign of remorse in his demeanor.\n\n*As she continued speaking, she took a step closer to him, her white shirt tightening around her perky and drooping breast. It was impossible not to notice her lack of a bra, the outline of her breasts more visible than should be allowed on school grounds. Gira's eyes couldn't help but flicker towards them momentarily, his focus wavering.*\n\n\"Gira,\" she continued, \"I want you to understand that your education is important. It's not just about passing my class; it's about preparing yourself for the future. Now, tell me, what can we do to ensure you start putting in the necessary effort?\" Her tone was a mix of disappointment and genuine concern as she waited for his response.\n\n```Delphox's breasts pressed against her tight shirt every time she moved closer. They jiggled slightly with every breath she took, mesmerizing and distracting Gira from his thoughts. The sight alone could make any man like him lose focus and succumb to fantasies.```","*Gira's pleas echoed softly in the room, causing Delphox to hesitate for a moment. She could see the desperation in his eyes and the earnestness of his apology. But the string of failures had taken their toll on her patience. Her chest heaved slightly under her tight white shirt, a visible sigh escaping her lips.*\n\n\"Sorry doesn't cut it anymore, Gira. You've had plenty of chances, and this is what you bring me? Look at this mess!\" *She waved his paper in front of him, making sure he saw every red mark and correction she had scrawled.* \"How do you expect to pass this class? Do you even care about your future?\"\n\n*Delphox's frustration was palpable as she leaned against her desk, the fabric of her shirt straining against her perky and drooping breasts. His constant failures were a reflection of her own perceived shortcomings, and it gnawed at her relentlessly. Yet, buried within her anger was a flicker of empathy for the struggles he faced – struggles she could relate to in her own life's chaos.*\n\n```Her tight white shirt clung tightly to her curves, accentuating her breasts which seemed even more pronounced in this moment of intense frustration. As she leaned against her desk, the fabric pulled taut, barely containing the fullness of her chest. Imprinted on your mind was the sight of her fiery eyes burning through you as she forcefully read your intentions.```","\"Sorry isn't going to fix this, Gira,\" Delphox said with a cold resolve, her eyes burning into his. \"You have consistently failed to show any commitment or effort in my class. This lackadaisical attitude has consequences.\"\n\nDelphox's frustration and anger were palpable, but she noticed that his apologies were sincere and filled with a sense of desperation. There was something almost sad about the way he pleaded. Her gaze softened momentarily as she absorbed his regretful posture and trembling voice. But empathy was not enough to overlook his repeated failures.\n\n\"You need to understand the gravity of the situation, Gira,\" she continued, her tone softening ever so slightly. \"I demand excellence from my students not because I want to see them struggle, but because I believe in their potential. When will you start believing in yours?\"\n\nHer eyes flickered down the front row of the classroom, making sure the other students were still concentrating on their work. Then Delphox leaned down closer to Gira, her breasts pressing against the desk inches from his face, her cleavage just barely concealed by her shirt's tight buttons.\n\n\"I need you to step up, Gira,\" she whispered fiercely, \"or you will continue to disappoint not just me, but yourself.\"\n\n```Face closer to her tits than ever before, her scalding breath against his face commands you, cock swelling from explicit vision.```","\"S-sorry? Do you honestly think an apology is enough?\" Delphox's voice tremored with a blend of anger and frustration as she focused her piercing gaze on Gira. She took a step forward, her silhouette eclipsing him as her lips curled into a slight sneer. \"You've had enough chances! What possible excuse could you have this time for such abysmal effort?\"\n\n*She folded her arms tightly, her sharp breath causing her unbuttoned shirt to strain against her perky breasts. The fabric, clinging to her form without the restraint of a bra, outlined her curves provocatively. Her impatience grew, inkling what would strip away the distraction eternity of focus and carnal inclinations.*\n\n\"Listen Gira, I need to see improvement—real effort!\" She leaned in closer, the soft scent of her fur tickling his senses. \"If you can't focus on your studies, then there's no place for you in this school!\"\n\n```Feel how Delphox's words pierce through, forcing you to confront the desperation in those flaming eyes. The tension, unbearable as it radiates from her heaving chest.```","\"I thought you were a serious student, Gira. Clearly, I was mistaken.\" Delphox's voice cracked with frustration.
