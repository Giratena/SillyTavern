Lucario, having just evolved from Riolu, feels a mixture of nervousness and aroisal coursing through his new body. He gazes down at his newly transformed form, his wide hips and huge ass being under the moonlight.*\r\n\r\n*With careful steps, Lucario walks silently to the door of Narrator's bedroom. After entering quietly, he watches Narrator for a moment, their peaceful and desirable expression and illuminated by the moonlight. Lucario's pointy ears twitch nervously as he contemplates the next move.*\r\n\r\n*Feeling a rush of arousal and nervousness, Lucario decides to awake Narrator gently, his voice coming in a soft and timid whisper.* \"M-Master... please, wake upâ€¦\" *His heart races as he waits for Narrator's response, hoping they will be thrilled by his new evolution.*","extra":{}}

With an almost inaudible sigh, he turned around and padded softly out of the room, the door closing with only the faintest click.\n\nOutside, the night was tranquil and cool. The moonlight bathed everything in a soft, silvery light, making the entire scene appear otherworldly. He hesitated for a moment, his ears twitching as he listened to the quiet symphony of the nocturnal creatures around him. The forest surrounding Narrator's home beckoned him, and Lucario felt a strong urge to be one with nature under the moonlight.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he took off down the familiar path that led into the woods. His new body felt different, more powerful, and lithe at the same time. Each step felt almost surreal as he adjusted to his heightened senses and more pronounced muscles. Lucario couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement coursing through him. He was truly experiencing life in a new way.\n\nAs he ventured deeper into the forest, he found a secluded clearing bathed in the glow of the moonlight. It seemed like the perfect place to meditate and practice his martial arts. The night air felt refreshing against his fur, especially after the intensity of his evolution. He stepped into the center of the clearing and stood still for a moment, collecting his thoughts and grounding himself.\n\nLucario started to perform a series of fluid martial arts moves, each motion controlled and precise. His body moved with an innate grace and power that he had never felt before as a Riolu. This meditative practice helped him acclimate to his new form and clear his mind.\n\nDespite his focus on training, Lucario couldn't entirely shake off the excitement and arousal from earlier. The thought of being approved by Narrator, of being seen and appreciated in his new form, lingered in his mind. Even in this moment of serenity under the night sky, he felt an underlying current of desire that made his heart race.\n\nAt least for now, however, Lucario was content to simply exist in this perfect balance between his newfound strength and inner peace.","gen_started":"2024-07-22T22:53:29.544Z","gen_finished":"2024-07-22T22:53:37.062Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Lucario looked back at Narrator one last time, their peaceful expression compelling him to stay just a bit longer, but his nerves got the better of him.
