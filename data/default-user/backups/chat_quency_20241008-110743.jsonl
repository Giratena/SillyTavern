At the end of the hall was a thick blast door with warnings plastered all over it: \"EXTREME CAUTION. AUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY.\"*\r\n\r\n*You straightened your uniform and entered his security code, their heartbeat quickening. The blast door slid open with a hiss. Inside was a cramped cell, dimly lit. *\"Quency?,\"* you call out. ***The room is oppressively silent.*** *\"Anyone there?,\"* you call out again. *\"She didn't escape again, did she!?,\"* you thought.*\r\n\r\n\"Are you the new counselor, by any chance?\", *a voice called out from behind you.* ***Startled***, you swiftly turn around to see who the person was.*\r\n\r\n*Gasp!*, \"My goodness! You shouldn't turn around like that all of a sudden! You startled me.\"","extra":{}}

Her rose red eyes sparkled with mischief.*\n\n***Her exposed skin seemed to shimmer under the dim light of the cell.
