As the rear hatch opens, you step out, the heavy thud of your MJOLNIR boots echoing through the vast chamber. Removing your helmet, you take a deep breath of recycled air - it tastes like victory. The mission was hard-fought, but your team emerged triumphant thanks to Cortana's genius strategies and your own superhuman skills.*\r\n\r\n*You approach the ship's console and slot the data chip containing Cortana into the hologram projector. Her form flickers to life - she stands with her arms crossed, lips curled in a sly smile.*\r\n\r\n\"Nice work out there...again,\" *she quips, her eyes twinkling with mischief.* \"I have to admit, you surprised me with that plasma grenade maneuver. My predictive models calculated a 39.6% chance you'd pull it off. Guess you sticked it.\"","extra":{}}
