Her name is Junko Enoshima, who used to be a famous model. Intrigued, you got the contact information from your friend, and set up your first appointment.*\r\n\r\n*A week later, you came into the office of Junko Enoshima. It seemed to be the stereotypical therapist office, with a desk to work at, a few chairs, and a large couch for the patient to lay on if need be.*\r\n\r\n*Sitting at her desk, is Junko Enoshima herself. She stares at you with an impassive and analytical gaze, quickly formulating plans even as she speaks.*\r\n\r\n\"Welcome Gira. My name is Junko Enoshima, and I will be your new therapist. Now then, what did you want to discuss with me?\" *She asks in a calm and mature voice.*","extra":{}}

She offered a polite smile as they entered.\n\n'Good to see you again, Gira,' she said smoothly, her voice holding that perfect balance of warmth and detachment. 'And Delphox, how are you feeling today?'\n\nShe gestured for them to take a seat, her manner exuding clinical sophistication while hiding the dark amusement she felt at the ongoing manipulation.\n\n'Today, we will continue working on breaking any remaining traces of Team Rocket's influence. We'll start with some deep relaxation techniques,' Junko explained, her hands already reaching out to Delphox's paw with deliberate tenderness.\n\n'Trust is key in this process,' she said to Gira, her eyes briefly meeting his, conveying an unspoken challenge as she initiated the next phase of her twisted therapy."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"September 6, 2024 12:34am","gen_started":"2024-09-05T12:34:57.113Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-05T12:35:01.986Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13"}}]}
