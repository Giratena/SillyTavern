What do you want?\" *His expression remained tough, his eyes sharp, and his posture unwavering, clearly indicating he wasn't here to seek any favors.*\n\nMarie lazily leaned against a pillar, her arms crossing under her large breasts, pushing them up slightly and distracting from the nonchalance of her demeanor. She smirked, her golden eyes catching the light and shimmering with mischief. \"Oh, what do I want? That's a loaded question...\" She took a step closer, her hips swaying gently with each movement. \"But for now, let's just say I'm curious about why you're so standoffish.\" Her voice was low and sultry, laced with an undertone that made it almost impossible to ignore.\n\nHer green tights clung tightly to her legs and ass, the fabric accentuating every curve and muscle with each step she took towards Gira. The slight bounce in her stride sent a teasing jolt through her ample chest, the squid-shaped pasties barely containing her big breasts beneath her outfit. As she closed the distance, the scent of her perfume - sweet yet almost intoxicating - filled the air around them.\n\n\"Being tough all the time must be exhausting,\" Marie mused softly as she reached out, her delicate fingers lightly trailing down Gira's arm. \"It wouldn't hurt to let loose every now and then.\" Her breath was warm against his skin as she leaned in, whispering into his ear, \"Why don't we see if we can help each other relax?\"\n\nThe music around them seemed to shift, becoming more seductive and entrancing. Soft beats and sultry rhythms filled the air, creating an almost hypnotic ambiance.

She crossed one leg over the other, the action causing her outfit to tighten around her full, soft thighs. The black romper hugged her curves snugly, making the pale skin of her large, shapely breasts nearly spill out from the top. Her white gloves idly traced over the edge of her neckline.\n\n\"What do I want?\" she echoed with a wry smile, her voice laden with seduction and mischief. She leaned forward, the movement making her breasts jiggle slightly as she rested her elbows on her knees. Her ample cleavage was now in full view, barely contained by her skimpy outfit. Her plus-shaped pupils glowed under the dim lights, adding an ethereal allure to her sultry gaze.\n\nMarie reached out and placed a hand on Gira’s shoulder, her touch gentle yet firm. \"Maybe I just want to understand what makes you tick,\" she purred, her tone dropping an octave as her fingers caressed his shoulder lightly. Her lime-green tongue flicked out briefly, moistening her lower lip. \"Or perhaps, I’m looking for some entertainment... Someone to keep me company in this rather dull night.\"\n\nThe hypnotic undertones in Marie’s voice seemed to weave a spell of their own, subtly pulling Gira into her web. \"So tell me,\" she continued, now whispering in his ear, her breath warm against his skin. \"What would you do if I said I wanted something more...intimate?\" Her hand trailed down his arm slowly, her touch both electrifying and unnervingly soothing at the same time. The music in the background pulsed with a steady, seductive rhythm, amplifying the atmosphere's sensuality.","*Gira's tone was cold and dismissive, not really surprised by her celebrity status.* \"I don't want anything.
