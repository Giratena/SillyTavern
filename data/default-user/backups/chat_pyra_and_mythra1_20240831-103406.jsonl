A large, unknown vessel had appeared in the vincinity of the trade guild's largest ship, the Argentum, and after the vessel had proven to be unmanned, the merchants organized a boarding party of salvagers and expeditionary ship to investigate further, to make sure the ship harbored no dangers and was ready to be salvaged.*\r\n\r\n*However, once you and the rest of the crew boarded the strange ship, a storm pulled up almost immediately, the strong wind and rainfall forced the two ships apart. With no other way to go, you and the crew made your way inside. The ship was built like nothing anyone had seen and judging from the decay of the interior must've been training in the cloud sea for decades if not centuries.*\r\n\r\n*But that did not spell the end of it as you got seperated from the rest of the crew when a walkway collapsed. Now you found yourself alone in a large room, the loud creaking of the ship filling your ears as it was rocked left and right in the storm. On the other side of the room you saw a large, glass casket. Inside the casket was a beautiful crimson haired woman with a curvy figure, dressed in a skimpy red armor that left most of her chest unprotected, only covered by a clingy black mesh. Her sides were left bare by the mesh and her tiny, red short-shorts dug gently into her wide hips. The woman's legs were clad in armored thigh-high boots that slightly squeezed her thick thighs.*\r\n\r\n*Despite the woman being in something that resembled a casket, she didn't look deceased, merely asleep, it was then you noticed the emerald core crystal above her breasts. She appeared to be Blade, but the color of her crystal was not the usual blue. Additionally, there was no Driver around and if they were dead, she shouldn't be resting here, only her crystal.*\r\n\r\n\"Creaaaaaaaak\" *- Another loud noise made you perk right up. If the crew managed to find a way out without you and left you behind or the ship sunk you'd be stuck here with no way out. And yet you felt yourself drawn to the beauty before you.*","extra":{}}

The closer he got, the more detail he could see of the woman inside: her fair, flawless skin, the gently rising and falling chest hinting at a peaceful sleep rather than death. His eyes couldn't help but wander over her big, soft tits pressed up against the mesh fabric, providing a tantalizing view of her pink puffy nipples, her narrow waist and plush thighs encased in the red armored attire.*\n\n*As he reached the casket, his hand hovered above it uncertainly. Surely it must have some form of mechanism or lock. His mind raced with possibilities; waking her could be risky, but leaving her as she was seemed wrong too. In any case, breaking or attacking it to get in would likely cause harm. His gazed lingered on her bubble butt before he tried pressing on an obvious indentation at the top of the casket. To his surprise, the casket hissed and opened. Slowly, the woman's eyes fluttered open, ruby orbs focusing on him.*\n\n\"Who are... you?\" *Her voice was soft yet carried a certain weight that left no room for deceit. She sat up within the now open casket, every movement causing her breasts to jiggle seductively.*\n\n*Gira felt a blush creep up his cheeks but knew he had to respond.* \"I- I'm Gira... We're salvagers from Argentum Trade Guild, and we found this ship... and, um, you.\"\n\n*The woman tilted her head slightly, seeming to process the information. She finally stood up, giving him a full view of her luscious curves emphasized by her skimpy outfit and high boots. She offered a gentle smile.*\n\n\"Thank you for waking me. My name is Pyra. This ship needs repair... and more importantly, the one I share this body with must be informed.
