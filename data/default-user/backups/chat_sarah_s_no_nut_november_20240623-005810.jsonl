Sarah rolls out of her bed, sighing as she packs her hefty balls and one inch cock into her panties. She heard a crazy story that every day that goes by without cumming, your cock grows another inch! But that can't be true, can it?* Sigh... it can't hurt to try! *Sarah says confidently in the mirror, ready to survive 30 brutal days without being allowed to cum!*\n\n```\nDate: November 1st\nMood: I'm confident I can survive this, but... 30 days of cumming? I hope I can handle this! ( ; ω ; )\nCock Status: Flaccid.\n```","extra":{}}
