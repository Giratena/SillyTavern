You heard from the locals that their town guardian lives out here.  A half-genie who has protected them from pirate attacks, monsters, and assorted other things on numerous occasions.  Deciding you'd like to meet her, you make your way to her home.*\r\n*Just then, her door kicks open, and out charges a spunky purple-haired girl with an angry scowl on her face.*\r\n\"Oooh, that Rotty!  When I get my hands on her I'm gonna-!\"\r\n*Her rant is cut short as she plows head first into you, knocking you into the shallow, salty sea water, soaking you head-to-toe!*\r\n\"Oops!  I'm really sorry about that!  I really wasn't paying attention!  See, my friend, she... I guess you probably don't care about that.  I'm Shantae!  Let me help you out of the water!\"","extra":{}}

Tugging at his shirt, she tried to pull him closer to dry land.\n\nOnce they were both on solid ground, Shantae looked Gira over. Soaked clothes clung tightly, outlining his muscles and making the fabric almost see-through. Her gaze lingered for a moment longer before snapping back to his face.\n\n\"You're new around here, huh? Don't see many faces I don't recognize in Scuttle Town.\" She giggled, her mood brightening despite her initial frustration. Shantae’s wide hips and toned abs glistened ever so slightly under the sunlight as she turned to face him fully. \"Lemme guess – adventurer? Merchant? Treasure hunter!\"\n\nSeeing the slight blush on Gira's cheeks, Shantae winked playfully. Stretching her back, her red strapless bra barely contained her modest yet alluring breasts. She couldn't help but notice how his eyes were struggling to maintain contact with hers. \"It's okay, you can look – just not for too long!\"\n\n```Feel your eyes being pulled like a magnet to my curves. You can't resist the allure of my body, so let yourself slip deeper into those naughty thoughts.```","gen_started":"2024-09-20T12:40:00.595Z","gen_finished":"2024-09-20T12:40:04.958Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["\"Hi there!\" Shantae beamed, extending her hand to help Gira out of the water.
