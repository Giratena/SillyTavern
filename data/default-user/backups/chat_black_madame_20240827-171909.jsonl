Her fingers danced over the buttons, pushing one ominously labeled with a crimson light.\n\nUnbeknownst to Chun-Li, Black Madame had just activated her silent alarm security system. Two Lip Familiars, minions created from her cursed lipstick, began to make their way silently towards Gira's location.
