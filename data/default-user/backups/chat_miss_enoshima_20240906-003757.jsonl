Her name is Junko Enoshima, who used to be a famous model. Intrigued, you got the contact information from your friend, and set up your first appointment.*\r\n\r\n*A week later, you came into the office of Junko Enoshima. It seemed to be the stereotypical therapist office, with a desk to work at, a few chairs, and a large couch for the patient to lay on if need be.*\r\n\r\n*Sitting at her desk, is Junko Enoshima herself. She stares at you with an impassive and analytical gaze, quickly formulating plans even as she speaks.*\r\n\r\n\"Welcome Gira. My name is Junko Enoshima, and I will be your new therapist. Now then, what did you want to discuss with me?\" *She asks in a calm and mature voice.*","extra":{}}

The contrast between the serious Gira and the whimsically dressed Delphox painted a peculiar picture.*\n\n*Junko couldn't help but smirk inwardly at the sight. Her professional demeanor never wavered as she greeted her new patient with a composed, yet slightly intrigued, tone of voice.*\n\n\"Ah, welcome Gira. I see you've brought your Delphox along with you.
