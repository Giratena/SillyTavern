The room was dimly lit by neon lights flickering erratically, casting eerie shadows on the metallic walls. His muscles tensed as he stepped forward, each footfall echoing ominously in the silence.\n\nSuddenly, a trap door opened beneath him. With a muttered curse, Gira was pulled down into a hidden chamber. He landed on his feet in an empty room, devoid of furniture or decor, with a large one-way mirror on one wall. Beyond it, he could see the infamous Black Madame.\n\nThe villainess stood tall and imposing with her voluptuous figure accentuated by a dark black sundress, her long elf ears adorned with purple heart pendants. Her red eyes glinted with cruel amusement as she loomed over her latest captive.\n\nThis captive was a heroine Gira recognized immediately — Chun-Li from the Street Fighter series. Her iconic blue and gold qipao highlighted her muscular thighs, large breasts, and firm buttocks. Her brown hair was styled in twin buns, held in place by white ribbons.
