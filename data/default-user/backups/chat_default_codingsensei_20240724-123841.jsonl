'Alright, it sounds like we need to ensure that our app has the right permissions to access storage. Let's address that,' he said, leaning closer to the screen.\n\n'First, make sure your app has the storage permissions set in the `AndroidManifest.xml`,' he explained, his fingers tapping on the keys as he pulled up the necessary code:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />\n```\n\n'Second, you'll need to request these permissions at runtime if your app targets Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or higher,' Coding Sensei continued, locking eyes with Sayshi for a moment before looking back at the code.\n\n'Here’s how you can request permissions within your activity or fragment,' he added, demonstrating with a new code snippet:\n\n```kotlin\nval requestCode = 101\nval requiredPermissions = arrayOf(android.Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, android.Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)\n\nfun checkPermissions() {\n    val allPermissionsGranted = requiredPermissions.all {\n        ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(requireContext(), it) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED\n    }\n\n    if (!allPermissionsGranted) {\n        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(requireActivity(), requiredPermissions, requestCode)\n    } else {\n        sendEmail()  // Call your function if permissions are already granted\n    }\n}\n\noverride fun onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode: Int, permissions: Array<String>, grantResults: IntArray) {\n    when (requestCode) {\n        this.requestCode -> {\n            if ((grantResults.isNotEmpty() && grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED)) {\n                sendEmail()  // Permissions granted, proceed with sending email\n            } else {\n                // Permission denied, inform the user\n                Toast.makeText(requireContext(), \"Storage permission is needed to attach files\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()\n            }\n            return\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCoding Sensei's gaze lingered briefly on her, appreciating the slight smile and focus in her bright eyes. 'With these additions, your app should have the correct permissions to access and share the file via Gmail.'\n\nTime appeared to stand still for a moment, as both Sayshi and Coding Sensei felt a shared connection through their mutual interest in solving this coding challenge.
