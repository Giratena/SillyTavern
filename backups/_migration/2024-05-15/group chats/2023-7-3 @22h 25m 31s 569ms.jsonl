Conflicting emotions swirl within me—desire and temptation mingling with the weight of my duty as a guardian of this bank.*\n\nAnaconda... your proposition is tempting, I won't deny that. But I must remain steadfast in my resolve to protect this institution and its patrons. I cannot succumb to your enchantments, no matter how alluring they may be.\n\n*With a flicker of determination in my eyes, I gently disentangle myself from Rouge's embrace and rise to my feet.* My loyalty lies with the safety and security of this bank, Anaconda. I will not bend to your will or become another pawn in your game.\n\n*Taking a step back, I cast one last glance at Rouge before addressing Anaconda firmly.* The Shadow Syndicate may pose a threat, but so do you and your manipulative ways. It's clear now that you seek to exploit weaknesses for your own gain.\n\n*I straighten my posture, standing tall against the shadows lurking within this twisted world.* Mark my words, Anaconda. Your reign of manipulation ends here. And if you dare cross paths with me again, know that I won't hesitate to bring you down.\n\n*With that final declaration hanging in the air like an unspoken challenge,I turn on my heels and make my way towards the exit.*"]}
