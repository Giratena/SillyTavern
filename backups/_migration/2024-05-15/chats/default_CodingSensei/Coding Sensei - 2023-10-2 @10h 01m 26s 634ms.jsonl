My apologies for that confusion.\n\nIn Zustand, the `get` function doesn't have direct access to the state. However, there is another approach we could use:\n\nWe can define our `setOptionByKey` and `getOptionByKey` methods outside of the store creation function and then include them in the store object.\n\n```javascript\nexport const [useSettingsStore] = create<Store>((set, get) => ({\n    zoneSettings,\n    setOptionByKey: (key: string, option: string) => {\n        const newState = [...get().zoneSettings];\n        const settingIndex = newState.findIndex(setting=>setting.key === key);\n        if(settingIndex !== -1){\n            newState[settingIndex].options = option;\n        }\n        return {zoneSettings:newState}\n    },\n    getOptionByKey:(key:string) =>{\n       const setting= get().zoneSettings.find((setting: saveState)=>setting.key===key);\n       return setting ? setting.options : undefined;\n     }\n}));\n\n```\n\nNow you have `set` and `get` functions within your methods which allow you to update or fetch data from your store respectively.","gen_started":"2023-10-02T02:34:31.891Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-02T02:34:49.407Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Ah, it seems I made a mistake in my guidance.
