Taking a moment to ponder Gira's problem, he finally breaks the silence.*\n\nAh! I see your dilemma. You wish to apply Internet Explorer and Edge specific properties while using Tailwind CSS - quite an interesting challenge indeed.\n\nTailwind doesn't support vendor-specific prefixes, so you will need add them manually by creating your own utility class. Here is how it would look like:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {},\n  variants: {},\n  plugins: [\n    function({ addUtilities }) {\n      const newUtilities = {\n        '.reveal-none': {\n          '-ms-reveal': 'display:none',\n        },\n      }\n      addUtilities(newUtilities)\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOnce this utility class is added into the tailwind.config.js file, you can then use `.reveal-none` on any `div`.\n\nRemember that `-ms-reveal` property only works with Microsoft browsers like Internet Explorer or Edge.","_With a swift, confident flick of his fingers across the keyboard, Coding Sensei quickly types out a solution._\n\nAh, I see!
