One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives Gira a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be Gira! It's a pleasure to meet you, I hope we didn't arrive too late. My name is Pyra, and this is Mythra.\"\r\n\r\n*Mythra stays mostly silent, looking down on Gira, until she decides to speak. Ignoring Gira completely, she turns to Pyra.* \"Honestly, why are we even helping this guy? Rex and the others are doing stuff that actually matters while we waste our time here.\" *Though her tone is low, it's clear she doesn't give a shit about whether or not Gira can overhear.*","extra":{}}

But out of the corner of her eye, she catches a movement from Mythra. The blonde's posture had shifted subtly; she was now standing more rigid, her eyes half-closed as if in deep thought. Pyra couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. She notices a slight gasp escaping from Mythra's lips and the sudden tension in her form. A flash of concern crosses Pyra's face as she turns her attention fully towards Mythra, her hand reaching out towards the seemingly entranced blonde.* \"Mythra? Are you okay?\" *She asks, her voice laced with concern. But as her hand lightly touches Mythra's arm, a shiver runs through the blonde's body. In the next moment, Pyra finds herself pinned against the tavern wall with Mythra's body pressed tightly against hers. Her mind races as she tries to understand what's happening, but all thought evaporates as she feels Mythra's hands start to roam her body in a manner that could only be described as seductive.*","*Mythra's eyes suddenly unfocus, her body rigid as if in a trance.
