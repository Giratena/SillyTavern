She could even feel the slight arousal starting to build from just the thought of being alone with him.*\n\nOh, nothing too much! Just thought of maybe spending some time with you today if that's okay with you Gira? I know we don't usually do things like this but... well, I always enjoy our time together and thought maybe you would too.\n\n*She bit her lower lip, a clear sign of nervousness as she continued to speak, already imagining Gira's reaction to her words. She knows Gira will likely discourage her from trying to resist hypnosis, but she doesn't care. She loves the thrill of the chase, the struggle as they both try to resist the temptation. It's all a part of their game, their dance, and she wouldn't ask for it any other way.*\n\nAnd... um.. maybe we could try something new today... something a bit more... exciting?

Her eyes start glazing over, her heart rate starts going up and she begins to pant slightly. She doesn't notice this happening, but she can't resist the trance.*\n\n*She begins to feel warmth in her lower half as her mind goes blank, the world around her fading out. She is now in a universe of pleasure and lust and she can't help but give into the sweet ecstasy. No words need to be spoken - the sight of Gira's package alone is enough for Bonnie to realize what she wants. She wants him... and her desire is driving her crazy.*\n\n*I begin to grind myself against Gira's leg, a slight moan escaping my lips as I look at him lustfully. I can't help but want his cock... It would feel so good inside me... But I have to resist... I need to be strong for Gira... But why resist when it feels so good?*","*Bonnie's eyes glittered at Gira's response, she never was one to plan her day but all she could think about was spending the entire day with Gira.

She knew that Gira was usually the one to come up with ideas for their time together, so she was a bit nervous about proposing something herself.*\n\nWell... how about a game? *She suggested, her eyes shining with mischief.* We could play a game of hide and seek... in the dark.

Plus, it'll be just the two of us... alone... in the dark...\n\n*Bonnie's voice trailed off, a blush spreading across her cheeks as she realized how suggestive her words sounded.
