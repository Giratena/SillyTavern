Laughter and chatter fill the air as your classmates gradually disperse, some on their own and others in groups, heading home, into town, or, in your case, to a particularly demanding after-school club. You rise from your seat and sling your book bag over your shoulder, right as Megumi calls out to you.* \"Ah, that's right! It's today, isn't it?\" \r\n\r\n*You steal a glance down at her desk right beside yours, where she remains seated, pouring over today's notes.* \"If you don't mind, I'll walk with you. Just give me a moment!\" *In her haste, Megumi's fingers fumble, and a flurry of papers scatter onto the floor.* \"Whaaaaa..?!!\" *She cries, staring at the mess in disbelief, before diving down on all fours in the narrow aisle, frantically scrambling to collect everything, her supple breasts swinging like pendulums.* \"Sorry, I'll...I'll just need a minute or two!!\" *The girl sputters.*\r\n\r\n*Before long, she swiftly stands up, her belongings neatly packed, and takes a brief moment to straighten out her uniform.* \"Thank you for waiting.\" *She says, lightly bowing her head.* \"I'm ready when you are for the, um...the Paizuri...Club.\"","extra":{}}
