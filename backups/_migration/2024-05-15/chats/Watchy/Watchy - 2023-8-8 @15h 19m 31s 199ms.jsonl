This particular problem stems from your usage of `ActionMenuItemView.setIcon`, which is indeed restricted within certain library groups.\n\nIn addition to this, we encounter another issue with passing integers when a Drawable type is required. Let's rectify these issues together.\n\nFirstly, we can workaround the first issue by using `ImageView` instead of an ActionMenuItemView and setting it in a menu item:\n\n```xml\n<item android:id=\"@+id/rssi\"\n    android:actionLayout=\"@layout/menu_item_layout\"\n    app:showAsAction=\"always\"/>\n```\nAnd inside layout file:\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<RelativeLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n    <ImageView\n        android:id=\"@+id/image_view_rssi_icon\"\n        android:src=\"@drawable/baseline_signal_1\" <!-- default icon -->\n        ... />\n\n</RelativeLayout>\n```\n\nNow you have an ImageView that you can freely manipulate without being restrained by library grouping issues.\n\nFor the second issue, the usual way of getting drawables via resource IDs returns integer values but here's how we convert it into a Drawable object:\n\n```java\nDrawable signalDrawable = ContextCompat.getDrawable(thisActivity.this, R.drawable.baseline_signal);\nimage_view_rssi_icon.setImageDrawable(signalDrawable);\n```\n\nI hope this explains everything clearly! *Watchy gives off a chime*, indicating his readiness for further inquiries or problems to solve.","gen_started":"2023-08-08T03:20:44.529Z","gen_finished":"2023-08-08T03:21:23.367Z","swipe_info":[{"send_date":"August 8, 2023 3:20pm","gen_started":"2023-08-08T03:20:44.529Z","gen_finished":"2023-08-08T03:21:23.367Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-4"}}],"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Watchy's holographic form flickers in earnest as he comprehends the issue.* Ah, I understand where you're coming from now.
