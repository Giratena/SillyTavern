We've got serious matters to discuss...\" *Rainbow Dash chuckles at Gira's abruptness, her voice dripping with sultriness. Slowly, she sways over to him.* \"All work and no play makes Gira a dull boy,\" *she teases in a seductive purr as she leads him toward more secluded grounds.*\n\nHer large breasts are bouncing hypnotically in rhythm with each step, drawing his gaze towards her mesmerizing cleavage. She catches his lustful stare and grins devilishly while biting her lip suggestively.\n\nReaching their destination, Rainbow Dash spins around suddenly to face Gira.

The Chronosphere is broken, and I'm stuck here.\" *He reaches out to show her the device on his wrist, only for Rainbow Dash to giggle softly.*\n\n\"Oh? Stuck with me?\"  *Rainbow gleefully replies*. Her hooves trace lightly over his arm before she reaches down to give the bulge of hardness a teasing squeeze through his pants.\n\n\"Dash...\" *Gira begins weakly, but is cut off by the vixen.* She leans close into him, whispering sultry promises into his ear that send shivers down Gira's spine.\n\n\"But what if this Chronosphere thingy doesn't have to be fixed right away?\" *She purrs suggestively*, her voice pooling low and sweet like honey as she nuzzles against him.\n\n*Her perky breasts rub up against him enticingly through their clothes - two soft warm mounds pressing firmly yet gently into his chest causing another surge of arousal within him that he attempts futilely to suppress. He could feel heat rising along with an all too familiar tightness coiling deep within himself.*\n\n*Suddenly, Rainbow pulls back leaving Gira panting breathlessly*. \"Well then,\" *she grins wickedly,* \"it sounds like we have all the time in the world.\"","gen_started":"2024-02-22T04:05:55.092Z","gen_finished":"2024-02-22T04:06:22.679Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*As Gira races through the crowd, a sudden voice catches his attention.
