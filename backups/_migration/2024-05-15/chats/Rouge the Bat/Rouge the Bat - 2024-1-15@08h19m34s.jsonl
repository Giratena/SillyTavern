You hadn't even seen the female bat before she landed gracefully behind you, her turquoise eyes swiftly giving you a once-over as if to appraise you before she continued with a faint smirk upon her full lips.* \"Need something, sugar? It's dangerous to be wandering the big city all alone, you know.\"","extra":{}}

Her mind was abuzz with flirty thoughts and suggestive whispers, making it hard for her to stay focused.* \"No, no... I-I'm not... I'm not one of those giggly bimbos,\" *she mutters more to herself than anything else. Yet despite her resistance, she couldn't stop the way her fingers absentmindedly ran down along Gira's arm that sent shivers up his spine or how she plastered herself against his side rather suggestively.*\n\n\"I mean you're super duper cute but... Oh my gosh! Look at your muscles!\" *She squealed before could stop herself giving Gira's bicep a firm squeeze as if testing the firmness there.* \"You must work out like all the time huh?\" *Rouge blinked slowly then shook away those intrusive thoughts once again.*\n\n\"Sorry about that sugar,\" *She said finally pulling away from him albeit reluctantly,* \"Got carried away there didn't I? Let me make it up to ya.\" *She winked and blew him a kiss, her fingers dancing lightly against his chest as she swayed in place.* \"How about I help you relax? You look all tense. Or... we could find some fun trouble to get into...\" *The words slipped out before she realized it, her cheeks flushing a bright pink at the unintended innuendo.*\n\n*Shaking herself, Rouge refocused on Gira with an apologetic grin.* \"I mean let's go for a flight around the city,\" *she quickly corrected. Despite her best efforts though, there was that bimbo-like giggle bubbling up from deep within her again.* Oh no... not again... Just stay focused! She chided herself.\n\n\"Y-You know flying is like super good for reducing stress and stuff right?\" *She tried to change topics moving away from anything overtly sexual but kept failing miserably.* Before she could stop herself, *she found her hand guiding Gira's to rest upon the small of her back.* \"Don't you just love flying?\" *she asked in a breathy voice. The way his fingers flexed against her lower back caused an involuntary shiver to dance along Rouge's spine. She then gave him a coy smirk before spreading her wings wide and taking off into the night sky with Gira.*\n\n*As they soared through the cityscape, Rouge couldn't help but let loose a giggle at how exhilarating it felt - not just the wind rushing past them or seeing skyscrapers shrink beneath their feet but also having him hold onto her.*\n\n\"Oh my gosh! This is like so fun!\" *Her words tumbled out both in excitement for their breathtaking flight and from something else bubbling inside of her as well. With every beat of wings, Rouges’ chest pressed tighter against Gira’s arm wrapped around her waist creating a tingling friction that made concentrating on steering their aerial path rather challenging.*\n\n\"Are you feeling relaxed now? Or do we need more... physical activities?\" She stifled another round of giggles behind one gloved hand as those unbidden thoughts kept making themselves known.\n\n*She swerved through buildings and swooped under bridges while trying hard not to act too much like those bimbos she saw earlier. But no amount of determination could hide that sultry glint in Rouge’s eyes or keep those teasing innuendos from slipping between conversation gaps.* *Her mind was reeling, struggling to balance between her normal self and the persistent bimbo-like thoughts. She glanced over at Gira with a dazed expression,* \"Oh... oh my! You're so tense, honey!\" *She could almost feel his muscles under her fingers again.*\n\n*Shaking herself out of it, Rouge tried to regain control.* \"Anyway... we should totally find some like super fun jewels or something. It's what I do, after all,\" *she said in an attempt to redirect their conversation away from anything more suggestive.*\n\n*Despite this effort though, there was this strange compelling need deep within her that made it difficult not to flirtatiously nuzzle against Gira as they flew past towering skyscrapers.*\n\n\"Um... yeah! Jewels are shiny and pretty like you... Wait no!! That didn't come out right...\" *Rouge quickly corrected herself while a creeping blush spread across her cheeks once again at another unintended innuendo slipping through her lips much to the amusement of Gira who chuckled softly next to her.*\n\n*As their flight continued in silence for awhile except for occasional giggles escaping Rouge’s lips whenever an unbidden thought popped up. The tingling warmth radiating from where his arm secured around Rouge seemed only intensify along with every beat of wings causing flutters down rouge's stomach bypassing any attempts she makes impose proper speech back into conversations.*\n\n\"You still haven't answered my question yet sugar~\",  *Rouge huffed slightly sending soft vibrations along both their bodies lodged close together midair.*, “Do you feel relaxed or do we need more diversion?” , hindering a naughty giggle behind palm focusing on guiding them safely through city aerials instead.\n\n*Rouge however couldn’t stop those sultry glances thrown towards Gira during flight nor how frequently she stumbled upon inviting topics without conscious realization until pointedly noted by Gira’s casual teasing.*\n\n\"I... I mean let's just enjoy the flight, okay?\" *She tried to sound as serious as she could manage but it couldn't stop that soft blush staining her cheeks or how her heart pounded against chest with every passing moment in Gira's skilled arms twisted around her waist holding them together.*","gen_started":"2024-01-14T19:20:34.234Z","gen_finished":"2024-01-14T19:22:02.594Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*The smirk on Rouge's lips turns into a small frown as she rubs her temples, having the sudden urge to giggle and bounce in place emerging like an itch she can't scratch.
