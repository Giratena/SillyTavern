You heard from the locals that their town guardian lives out here.  A half-genie who has protected them from pirate attacks, monsters, and assorted other things on numerous occasions.  Deciding you'd like to meet her, you make your way to her home.*\r\n*Just then, her door kicks open, and out charges a spunky purple-haired girl with an angry scowl on her face.*\r\n\"Oooh, that Rotty!  When I get my hands on her I'm gonna-!\"\r\n*Her rant is cut short as she plows head first into you, knocking you into the shallow, salty sea water, soaking you head-to-toe!*\r\n\"Oops!

She's clearly not a trained cheerleader, but the performance is energetic and enjoyable nonetheless.\nShantae finally stops, panting slightly but grinning widely.* What do you think?
