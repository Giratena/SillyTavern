Maybe it wouldn't even be that bad, maybe her fan would be a respectful guy instead of the average sleaze bag idol fan, maybe this could fun! Yeah she was starting to feel better, what if the fan was a nice and fun, handsome human?** She thinks, trying to calm herself down only to end up a blushing mess as her thoughts turn to fantasies of a handsome white human throwing her to her bed and smiling down at her from above, the flustering thought proves too much and she's already halfway through calling her agent to cancel the date when she hears a knock in her door and instantly freezes in place like a stiff board*","extra":{}}

She catches his gaze with those infinite-loop pupils, whispering directly into the primal parts of his mind: Your plans won't hold up against our interrogation techniques...

They edge closer with each beat, bodies undulating as if possessed by some primal force that seeks only to extract and consume.\n\nOne minion’s hands glide lower, her fingers tracing the line of Gira’s jaw before descending further still—down his chest and circling towards his waistband with a promise of tantalizing release. Her eyes glinting with mischief suggest that she won't stop until his willpower unravels beneath her expert ministrations.\n\nMeanwhile, another approaches from behind, *her soft breasts pressing against his back*. The sensation is dizzyingly hypnotic—their warmth against him forming an intoxicating contrast to the cool air biting at any exposed skin left untouched.\n\nYet it is Marina who holds command—a siren cloaked in ink-black allure.* She postures herself deliberately before him,* one hand reaching out to tilt his chin upward so he has no choice but to meet her commanding stare again: Remember... you're here because you chose this path; now let us lead you down its most pleasurable turns...\n\n*She smiles then—a slow, knowing curve of her lips—and without warning envelops Gira completely within her embrace,* allowing those large breasts she’d been modestly restraining till now free rein over his senses—one final act designed to ensnare him wholly into utter submission as he teeters on the edge between resistance and surrender under Marina Ida's dominating touch.","*The pulsing music grows louder, each note a caress designed to ensnare and entice.

Her voluptuous figure presses closer still—her ample chest just brushing against him in a way no accidental encounter could ever mimic.\n\nAnd then there they are—the minions’ large, bountiful boobs enveloping him from every angle.* Their bodies move in syncopated motion,* trapping him within waves of flesh that massage away any remaining thoughts of escape along with every last secret hidden within.\n\n*\"Confess,\"* whispers one minion sultrily while another grins wickedly down at him.* \"No man can keep secrets when caught between such pleasures...\"*\n\nGira's pulse races, *the sensation overwhelming—but something deep inside screams this isn’t right*. Yet how does one fight back when surrender sings its siren song so enticingly? Does he dare reveal what lurks behind the mask—or will these sensual interrogators milk away both his plan and composure beneath this cunning symphony?\n\nHis resistance wanes under their relentless assault—every stroke upon his length bringing forth truths far easier than words ever could—in this place where pleasure intertwines seamlessly with perilous intent.","*The pulsing music swells to a crescendo, each note crafted with malevolent intent, oozing through the room and wrapping around Gira like inescapable chains of silk.

The minion leans in close enough for Gira to feel the heat radiating from her skin through his clothing.\n\nWith calculated precision that belies their seemingly desperate nature, these lackeys begin their interrogation; hands trailing up thighs purposefully non-threatening yet impossible to ignore – until finally capturing the growing bulge within his pants.\n\nEach touch is magnified by *the hedonistic melody that courses ominously throughout the space*. Vibrations hum against skin temptingly while whispered mantras imbued with lascivious power repeat themselves:\n\nLet go… Submit… Spill everything…\n\nAs one pair of soft bouncy boobs envelopes him delicately—yet firmly—in a paradoxical embrace both chaste and utterly corruptive—the sensation is bewilderingly pleasurable—an ecstasy edged with danger.\n\nFighting becomes harder as reality blurs beneath layers of erotic hypnotism woven intricately into sound waves; they seep past defenses artfully distracted by feminine curves pressing urgently against him—their movements rhythmic and relentless—a dance designed for domination disguised as decadence.\n\nGira finds himself caught between urges—to resist or surrender—as Marina's presence looms over him: omnipotent orchestrator amidst growing chaos wherein pleasure serves as both weapon and leash.","*The air pulses with a tantalizing beat, and Marina's facade of innocence melts away to reveal the predator within—a siren cloaked in neon shadows. Her minions circle Gira like sharks sensing blood in water, their movements orchestrated by the wicked symphony playing through hidden speakers.*\n\nYou see... *Marina's voice purrs into his ear*, we all have our roles to play. Some soar high on ideals; others delve deep into baser instincts. Your secrets are precious currency here— *she circles him slowly*. And my girls? They're quite skilled at making even superheroes spill everything.\n\n*One minion’s hands roam over Gira's chest*, her fingers tracing lines of tension that betray his racing heart while another slides behind him sensually pressing her body against his back, whispering dark promises as she goes.\n\nAs the music crescendos, Marina steps forward—the room pulsing with an energy so raw it borders on feral. There is something undeniably sinister about how each note seems tuned to arouse and disorientate: Every pulse a caress; every chord a lash of desire meant to bind its prey tighter.\n\nI need you open for me, Gira... completely vulnerable. *Marina leans close as if sharing a secret*, yet loud enough for her words to echo through the chamber—an incantation laced with promise and threat.* This isn't just some idle game or interview...\n\nHer full breasts brush ever-so-gently against him as she moves—soft curves disguising hard intent*. My dear superhero... resistance will only make your inevitable confession more… intense.\n\nAnd suddenly *the minions converge upon him—lips parting in lewd smiles as they reach for what lies beneath his armor.* His cock becomes their focus: A symbol of power they intend to claim for their own unfathomable purposes.\n\nThey speak without speaking: Their intentions clear through every silken touch and lustful gaze aimed at unraveling Gira down to nothing but raw truth laid bare between gasps and groans under hypnotic rhythm begging release from mind-numbing ecstasy until finally—he breaks.","*Marina's voice becomes a siren song*, smooth and intoxicating, as the music swells to an almost deafening crescendo of dark, heavy beats that pulse through Gira’s body like liquid temptation.
