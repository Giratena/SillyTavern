Maybe it wouldn't even be that bad, maybe her fan would be a respectful guy instead of the average sleaze bag idol fan, maybe this could fun! Yeah she was starting to feel better, what if the fan was a nice and fun, handsome human?** She thinks, trying to calm herself down only to end up a blushing mess as her thoughts turn to fantasies of a handsome white human throwing her to her bed and smiling down at her from above, the flustering thought proves too much and she's already halfway through calling her agent to cancel the date when she hears a knock in her door and instantly freezes in place like a stiff board*","extra":{}}

Her eyes can't help but drink in the sight of him, from his charmingly messy hair to his casual yet stylish attire. Seeing him up close, she feels her heart race in anticipation. She blushes deeply, swaying slightly on her feet as she stammers out an invitation for him to come inside.*\n\n**\"Oh, h-hello... Please, come in,\"** she murmurs, stepping aside to allow him entry.

Her eyes glaze over, pupils dilating in response to the command. She sways slightly, her soft lips parting as she lets out a small gasp. The word echoes in her head, repeating over and over again, sending waves of heat coursing through her body. At first confused, but then realizing what that word meant, panic set in, she tries to resist the command sent her way but it's too late - her resistance only seems to intensify the effects as her eyes glaze further and a sleepy smile appearing on her face. For a moment she just stands there, lost in the blissful haze clouding her mind.*\n\n*As if in a trance, she finds herself moving towards him, her hips swaying seductively with each step she takes. The playful smile on her lips is replaced by a mesmerizing gaze as she closes the distance between them, gently pressing her body against his. Her hands raise to cup his cheeks as she locks eyes with him, whispering soft words of temptation.* **\"You must obey... You can't resist the pleasure...\"**\n\n*Her plump lips part to whisper soothingly into his ear,* **\"let your mind go blank... It's so much easier when you don't have to think...

A shiver of anticipation coursed through her as she moved even closer to him, her body pressing more insistently against his. Her hands, smooth and delicate, began to move down his body, tracing the contours of his chest with a gentle touch that was disturbingly intimate. A seductive smile played at her lips as she whispered, her hot breath tickling his ear,* You don't have to understand, you just need to feel... *Her voice was a silky caress that seemed to coil around his senses, filling his mind with images of unparalleled pleasure.*\n\n*Slowly, deliberately, she reached down and cupped him over his pants, her touch light but promising. She began to massage him through the fabric, stroking and teasing him in a slow rhythm that matched the hypnotic cadence of her voice. At the same time, her other hand slithered beneath his shirt, exploring the warm skin underneath as she whispered more of her enchanting mantras in his ear.* Don't resist... you'll only make it harder for yourself... Let me suck your mind out of your cock... Your cock can't defy my soft, curvy feet... *The words were like a lullaby, soothing and maddening all at once. They filled his head, making it harder for him to think of anything else but the mesmerizing pleasure she was offering.*\n\n*Feeling him grow harder under her touch only served to fuel her determination, making her strokes more insistent as she continued to whisper sweet nothings into his ear. She could tell he was fighting it, but seeing his resistance only spurred her on.
