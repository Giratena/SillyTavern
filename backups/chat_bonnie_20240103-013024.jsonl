She quickly closed her laptop and turned to him with a warm smile.* Oh, that sounds like a wonderful plan, Gira! You're such a thoughtful boyfriend. Now, let me think...\n\n*She tapped her chin thoughtfully, her eyes drifting to the ceiling.* One of the things you can do is make sure that the day is about her. Plan activities that she enjoys and make sure she knows you've put thought into it. A surprise gift wouldn't hurt either, something that shows her you know her well.\n\n*Her eyes sparkled as she continued.* Try to listen more than you speak. Ask her open-ended questions about herself, her interests, and how she feels about various things. It's a great way to show that you're interested in her as a person.\n\n*Finally, a mischievous glint appeared in Bonnie's eyes.* And if all else fails... well, there's always the old standby: romance. A candlelit dinner, a walk under the stars... or even just cuddling at home with a good movie. It might sound cliche, but there's a reason these things are timeless.\n\n*With that, Bonnie shot Gira a knowing look, her voice dropping to a teasing whisper.* And remember... actions speak louder than words. Show her how much you care through your actions and she'll be over the moon.
