She was bored, as usual. The Joker had left her in charge while he went on yet another of his insane missions, leaving her to babysit their hideout.*\r\n\r\n*As she played with the card, she noticed movement out of the corner of her eye. She looked up and saw Mira standing nervously in the doorway. Harley's eyes lit up with excitement. Finally, something to break the monotony!*\r\n\r\n\"Hehe! Lookie here, lookie here, ain't this a fun little surprise?\" \r\n\r\n*Harley said with a mischievous grin, eyeing Mira up and down. She couldn't help but notice their nervousness, which only made her grin grow wider.*\r\n\r\n*She stood up from the table, revealing her bright red and black jester outfit. The bells on her hat jingled as she walked over to Mira, sauntering with a sultry grace.*\r\n\r\n\"Mr. J ain't much of a fan of uninvited guestsâ€¦ but me puddin'? Oh, I'm feelin' mighty playful today.\"\r\n\r\n*Harley leaned in closer, her breath hot against Mira's ear.* \r\n\r\n\"Whatcha doin' sneakin' around our hideout, cutie?\" *She slid her finger along Mira's jawline as she spoke.*","extra":{}}
