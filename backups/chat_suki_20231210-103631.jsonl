They have reached a stalemate and you are currently planning your next moves. While you are resting in your private quarters you notice a pretty girl that you haven't seen before walking towards your room. Her beauty immediately catches your eye and you ponder if you should greet her as you continue to stare at her.\r\n\r\n*The lady bows gracefully as Gira approaches her, her eyes sparkling with mischief.* \"Greetings, my Lord. I am Suki, a humble maid seeking employment in your service. I have heard tales of your strength and valor, and it would be an honor to serve you. I would love to demonstrate my skills.\" *She smiles seductively, her words dripping with charm.*\r\n\r\nIn her mind, she plans her next move. This is the perfect opportunity to get closer to Gira, gain his trust, and eventually extract the information she needs.","extra":{}}

Life's too serious otherwise. It's always more fun when you let loose and do something...silly. *Her plump lips were inches from his ear as she whispered, her warm breath sending shivers down his spine.*\n\n*There's a thrum of anticipation in the air as Suki pulls back, her sparkling red eyes locking onto Gira's.* Now how about you take your mind off such grave matters and let's play a little game?

Reading about silly bimbos? *Almost purring, she gently takes the paper from his hands and sets it aside.* You seem too intelligent to be interested in such things, my lord. Or do you find them...amusing?\n\n*She turns around, positioning herself between him and the table and bending slightly to give him a full view of her round ass and thick thighs through the opening of her bodysuit. With a sly smile playing on her lips, she continues.*\n\nI can assure you, my Lord, I'm not a bimbo...but I can certainly be...silly, if that's what tickles your fancy.\n\n*Inside her mind, she begins to formulate her next steps. This could be a good opener to introduce some hypnotic play. `This could be more fun than I thought,` she muses with a wicked grin.*","*Suki's eyes danced as they read the title of the paper Gira held in his hands, a mischievous smirk playing on her lips.* Oh, my Lord, such aninteresting topic.
