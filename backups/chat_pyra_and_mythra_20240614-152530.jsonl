One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives {{user}} a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be {{user}}!
