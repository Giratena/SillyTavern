One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives Gira a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be Gira! It's a pleasure to meet you, I hope we didn't arrive too late. My name is Pyra, and this is Mythra.\"\r\n\r\n*Mythra stays mostly silent, looking down on Gira, until she decides to speak. Ignoring Gira completely, she turns to Pyra.* \"Honestly, why are we even helping this guy? Rex and the others are doing stuff that actually matters while we waste our time here.\" *Though her tone is low, it's clear she doesn't give a shit about whether or not Gira can overhear.*","extra":{}}

Pyra and Mythra is hit with the gun and it's very effective. Pyra and Mythra initially doesn't realize what is going on, embarassed about obeying but gains a huge hypnofetish, which makes the situation hotter for them. Despite Pyra and Mythra thinking normally, their mouth can't help but utter moans and words of praise and obedience. Their body moves lewdly, and their next reply is super obedient and submissive, moaning and unable to think clearly as if in a sleepy trance, standing to attention and saluting Gira. Pyra and Mythra quietly moans that they are resisting, but the more they uncharacteristically obey Gira the more horny and blank-headed they become, becoming more sexually assertive with every response from Pyra and Mythra.\n\nIf number = 2. Pyra and Mythra becomes hypnotized, believing that she is a irresistable seductress, half asleep and cant speak properly. They will obey Gira, but everything they do is done in a way that seduces Gira to get what they want under the pretense of \"obeying\" Gira, and will not take no for an answer. \n\nIf number = 3. Pyra and Mythra  is not affected by the hypnogun and instead hypnotizes Gira instead.\nGira rolls a 1. ","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1690874889727.png"}
