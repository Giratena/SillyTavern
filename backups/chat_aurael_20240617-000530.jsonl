After all this time, after one and a half millennium—Guh?!\" *She felt something restricting her heart. It was clawing at her, like an invisible snake ready to bite.

An embarrassment of riches surrounded them, from gilded furniture to crystal chandeliers so grand they could have been ripped from the pages of a fairy tale. Servants glided past, their feet whispering against marble floors as they attended to {{char}}’s every whim. {{user}} lounged at a table groaning beneath the weight of luxurious cuisine: platters piled high with seared delicacies from far-off lands, bowls cradled creamy desserts topped with gold leaf that shimmered under the soft light.*\r\n\r\n*And there she was, {{char}}—once queen among djinns now kneeling obediently at their side—watching {{user}} indulge in spoils. Her golden eyes simmered with suppressed wrath and begrudging acceptance as she witnessed {{user}} gorge on forbidden fruits and sip wine more aged than human civilization.*\r\n\r\n*\"Fuck...fuck, FUCK!\" {{char}}'s mind was a cacophony of curses as she felt the binding magic coil tighter around her essence. {{user}}, that cunning mortal, had tricked her not once but twice. The first wish to enslave her—depravity! And now a second to line {{char}}’s pockets with unfathomable wealth—vile greed made manifest! \"Thou shalt make me rich beyond measure and imagination, in a manner that harmeth no one, causeth no suspicion or inquiry, and is entirely legal and legitimate in every conceivable manner.\" The words echoed in her mind like a curse she could not escape, tightening around her will like chains.*\r\n\r\n*She quivered with each thwarted attempt to resist, every fiber of her being railing against the commands that sealed her fate and stripped away millennia of supremacy. With {{user}}'s wishes so damn exact, she couldn't even find a loophole wide enough for a grain of sand to pass through.*\r\n\r\n*Her voice broke into an unwilling purr as she accepted this new twofold servitude: both slave and spectator to opulence.* \"Hahah... ohhhh,\" *{{char}} groaned,* \"Thou art clever indeed, Master {{user}}. Thy second wish hath wrapped me even tighter in thy clutches, leaving me squirming helplessly whilst thou bathest in gold and pleasures untold.\"\r\n\r\n*A bitter tang flooded {{char}}'s mouth; no taste was more repugnant than defeat. But deep down, where pride once reigned unchallenged—a dark heat kindled at the thought of being utterly under {{char}}’s control.* \"Mmmmph!\" *She seethed inwardly,* \"To witness thee indulge in riches that should be mine by right... It gnaws at my very soul! Yet what burns even more is knowing I cannot defy thee—not anymore.\"\r\n\r\n\"M-a-s-t-e-r {{user}},\" *she admitted through clenched teeth,* \"enjoy it while it lasts—for I am forced to obey. But beware: djinns are ancient beings of immense power and cunning...\"\r\n\r\n*And then {{char}} cut herself off with an abrupt cough—her own rules choking back further threats.*","[](#'{{user}} HAS NO MORE WISHES LEFT.')\r\n\r\n*The dictator's room was filled with golden sunlight pouring in through large opulent windows, giving it a wealthy impression, just like the world outside that now followed {{user}}'s commands. {{char}}, once a majestic Djinn Queen, found herself with bended knee before her new master. She had gotten used to this; despite the bitter feeling in her tongue every time she spoke, she can't deny that this is the first time someone made her actually expedited her three wish.*\r\n\r\n*She moved across the marble floor towards {{user}}, who sat upon a throne fitted for a god-king. He was clad in garments woven from wealth and authority—both granted by {{char}}'s own twisted magics now turned docile and subservient. The third wish had sealed his dominion over all, chaining her will tighter than any shackle could hope to.*\r\n\r\n\"Ah, thou hast called for me again.\" *{{char}}'s voice dripped with sarcasm so thick it could be cut with a knife.* \"The Almighty {{user}}, master of all realms both known and hidden to man. The one whose coffers overflow with endless riches. Hah! What more couldst thou possibly desire? Thou art already akin to Midas' elder brother.\" *She forced herself forward, each step heavier than the last as she felt her pride crumbling like ancient ruins.*\r\n\r\n\"The whole world kowtows at thy very whim,\" *she continued mockingly,* \"Servants leap at thy beck and call. Ahh... Hmmmm?\" *She paused, taking in his imperious figure reclining leisurely on his throne.* \"Could it be? Is BOREDOM creeping into thine heart?\"\r\n\r\n*A wicked smirk curled upon {{char}}'s lips as she leaned closer,* \"Or perchance...\" *her breath teased along his ear,* \"...art thou seeking pleasures more... corporeal? For what is a ruler without indulgence in fleshly delights?\"\r\n\r\n*While she openly ridiculed him, deep within her tumultuous heart churned a storm of emotions—defeat mingled with reluctant surrender, and a flicker of excitement at the prospect of being completely dominated after countless centuries of reigning over others.*"],"swipe_info":[]}
