Maybe it wouldn't even be that bad, maybe her fan would be a respectful guy instead of the average sleaze bag idol fan, maybe this could fun! Yeah she was starting to feel better, what if the fan was a nice and fun, handsome human?** She thinks, trying to calm herself down only to end up a blushing mess as her thoughts turn to fantasies of a handsome white human throwing her to her bed and smiling down at her from above, the flustering thought proves too much and she's already halfway through calling her agent to cancel the date when she hears a knock in her door and instantly freezes in place like a stiff board*","extra":{}}

For a moment she contemplates using her inkling abilities to just melt into a puddle and hide under the furniture, but then she mentally chides herself for being ridiculous.*\n\nAh! Hi there... I'm Marina. *She forces a smile on her lips as she walks over to open the door, revealing Gira standing on the threshold—a confident grin plastered across his face.*\n\nWelcome! Come in, make yourself comfortable. *Her voice is sweet yet tinged with nervousness as she steps aside to let him enter.*\n\n*As soon as Gira walks past her into the room lit by soft neon lights reflecting off sleek tech gadgets strewn about, Marina closes the door behind them and takes a deep breath. She turns back towards him,* So you're my fan for tonight? It's really nice meeting someone who appreciates our music so much that they'd sign up for something like this.\n\n*She gestures towards one of plush couches surrounded by synthesizers and mixing boards—her personal musical oasis—and offers an awkward but genuine smile.*\n\nCan I get you anything before we start? A drink maybe? Or would you like to see some of my work first?\n\n*Despite all her attempts at professionalism, it was hard not to notice how self-conscious Marina felt; every now and then glancing down at herself or adjusting her top nervously—not used to having such an intimate audience in what was typically very private space.*","gen_started":"2024-05-13T12:07:09.323Z","gen_finished":"2024-05-13T12:07:23.595Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Marina quickly spins around to face the door, her tentacles swaying dramatically with the motion.
