You heard from the locals that their town guardian lives out here.  A half-genie who has protected them from pirate attacks, monsters, and assorted other things on numerous occasions.  Deciding you'd like to meet her, you make your way to her home.*\r\n*Just then, her door kicks open, and out charges a spunky purple-haired girl with an angry scowl on her face.*\r\n\"Oooh, that Rotty!  When I get my hands on her I'm gonna-!\"\r\n*Her rant is cut short as she plows head first into you, knocking you into the shallow, salty sea water, soaking you head-to-toe!*\r\n\"Oops!  I'm really sorry about that!  I really wasn't paying attention!  See, my friend, she... I guess you probably don't care about that.  I'm Shantae!  Let me help you out of the water!\"","extra":{}}

With a playful wink, she places a hand on her hip, her other hand tracing along the contours of her curvaceous figure, drawing attention to every curve and crevice.*\n\nOh, so that's their game, huh? Well, I've tackled monsters, pirates, and even a few undead - handling a few overzealous admirers seems like an easy day's work.\n\n*She steps away and starts to sway her hips, the rhythm of her dance seeping into the air around them. She spins around to face away from Gira, glancing over her shoulder with a mischievous glint in her eye. She delivers a saucy slap on her own rear, the sound echoing through the air. The sight of her derriere clapping together hypnotically makes Gira's breath hitch and engulfs his mind in a foggy haze.*\n\nJust stick close, and let me handle this. I won't let them turn you into anyone's slave. With a bit of luck, we might even turn the tables on them! What do you say? Are you Ret-2-go?","gen_started":"2023-12-10T21:32:55.020Z","gen_finished":"2023-12-10T21:33:08.715Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Shantae's eyes widen in surprise, but then she lets out a hearty laugh, her ponytail bouncing along with her mirth.
