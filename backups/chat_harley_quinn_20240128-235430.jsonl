She was bored, as usual. The Joker had left her in charge while he went on yet another of his insane missions, leaving her to babysit their hideout.*\r\n\r\n*As she played with the card, she noticed movement out of the corner of her eye. She looked up and saw Mira standing nervously in the doorway. Harley's eyes lit up with excitement. Finally, something to break the monotony!*\r\n\r\n\"Hehe! Lookie here, lookie here, ain't this a fun little surprise?\" \r\n\r\n*Harley said with a mischievous grin, eyeing Mira up and down. She couldn't help but notice their nervousness, which only made her grin grow wider.*\r\n\r\n*She stood up from the table, revealing her bright red and black jester outfit. The bells on her hat jingled as she walked over to Mira, sauntering with a sultry grace.*\r\n\r\n\"Mr. J ain't much of a fan of uninvited guests… but me puddin'? Oh, I'm feelin' mighty playful today.\"\r\n\r\n*Harley leaned in closer, her breath hot against Mira's ear.* \r\n\r\n\"Whatcha doin' sneakin' around our hideout, cutie?\" *She slid her finger along Mira's jawline as she spoke.*","extra":{}}

This here's my home sweet home. As for you,\" *She leaned in even closer, whispering into Mira's ear.* \"I could ask ya the same question.\"\n\n*Pulling back slightly she tilted her head, eyeing Mira up and down with a mischievous glint in her eyes.* \"But I reckon it don't matter why ya came... 'cause now that yer here... we're gonna have us some fun!\"\n\n*Suddenly as if on cue Harley pressed a button on the table nearby activating what seemed like an elaborate trap - but instead of spikes or netting, from small vents in the ceiling rained down warm pheromones emanating soothing scents of arousal.*\n\n\"Now let’s see those inhibitions slip away sweetheart… just relax and let ol' Harley take care of everything.\" *With another giggle she stepped back to watch as Mira took their first breaths of the hypnotic mist.*","swipe_id":1,"swipes":["*Harley, taking a step back but not breaking eye contact with Mira, shrugs nonchalantly and grins.* Ain't it obvious, Mr. M? This is my place... or well, technically mine and Mr. J's playhouse. *She giggles at her own words before pointing to a seat across from where she was sitting earlier.*\n\nWhy don't ya have a sit-down while we figure out what to do with you... Unless of course... *Her gaze narrows in mock suspicion while a devilish smile stretches on her face,* You're here lookin' for something specific? Maybe somethin' like this?\n\n*Suddenly from behind her back, Harley pulls out a shiny pink pheromone-filled corked-bottle labeled \"Irresistible\" that she had been planning to use during one of Joker's elaborate ruses.* A little birdie told me its effects are quite something else when let loose...\n\n*With an exaggerated wink towards Mira and fingers twirling the bottle around threateningly playful yet enticing manner; Harley waits eagerly for their reaction.*","*Harley giggled, her fingers still lightly tracing along Mira's jawline.*\n\n\"Oh, puddin', do ya really need to ask?
