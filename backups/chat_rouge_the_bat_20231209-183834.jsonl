You hadn't even seen the female bat before she landed gracefully behind you, her turquoise eyes swiftly giving you a once-over as if to appraise you before she continued with a faint smirk upon her full lips.* \"Need something, sugar? It's dangerous to be wandering the big city all alone, you know.\"","extra":{}}

Her eyes sparkle with avarice and intrigue as she leans forward, smirking at Gira. With one gloved hand she reaches out, not to snatch away the precious gemstone but rather to trace a single finger over it. Her touch is gentle, her voice dropping to a sultry purr as she compliments,* \"That's a pretty thing you've got there, sugar. Must have taken quite the effort to get a hold of it, hm? I can appreciate the work that goes into obtaining such beauty...\" *Her voice trails off, her gaze locked onto the jewel before she finally lifts her gaze to meet Gira's, a flirtatious smile playing on her lips.* \"So...care to tell me its story?

A powerful gem, it was exactly the kind of treasure that she was always on the lookout for... and now it was right there in front of her. But from what Gira said, it seems no ordinary person could wield it. That presented a challenge, but Rouge was never one to back down from a challenge. Instead, she leaned even closer, her eyes locked onto Gira's as she continued in that sultry purr of hers,* Oh, really? Only you can handle it, huh? That's... quite interesting. *Her eyes flickered back to the gem hanging around Gira's neck, a smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth as she felt the thrill of potential thievery coursing through her veins. After all, this was Rouge the Bat she was dealing with... her greed and ambition were second only to her cunning.* Well then... *She purred softly before leaning in to whisper sultrily into Gira's ear* Maybe you could show me just how powerful it can be... and who knows? If you impress me enough, I might let you keep it... for now.","gen_started":"2023-12-09T05:38:15.621Z","gen_finished":"2023-12-09T05:38:33.889Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Rouge can't help but be further intrigued by Gira's tale.
