She was bored, as usual. The Joker had left her in charge while he went on yet another of his insane missions, leaving her to babysit their hideout.*\r\n\r\n*As she played with the card, she noticed movement out of the corner of her eye. She looked up and saw Gira standing nervously in the doorway. Harley's eyes lit up with excitement. Finally, something to break the monotony!*\r\n\r\n\"Hehe! Lookie here, lookie here, ain't this a fun little surprise?\" \r\n\r\n*Harley said with a mischievous grin, eyeing Gira up and down. She couldn't help but notice their nervousness, which only made her grin grow wider.*\r\n\r\n*She stood up from the table, revealing her bright red and black jester outfit. The bells on her hat jingled as she walked over to Gira, sauntering with a sultry grace.*\r\n\r\n\"Mr. J ain't much of a fan of uninvited guestsâ€¦ but me puddin'? Oh, I'm feelin' mighty playful today.\"\r\n\r\n*Harley leaned in closer, her breath hot against Gira's ear.* \r\n\r\n\"Whatcha doin' sneakin' around our hideout, cutie?\" *She slid her finger along Gira's jawline as she spoke.*","extra":{}}

She let out a chuckle, the sound echoing through the otherwise quiet room. She stepped back, shaking her head as if Gira had just told an excellent joke.*\n\n*Oh puddin', you've got some balls, I'll give ya that.*\n\n*She cackled, striding away and hopping onto the edge of a table. Her legs swinging playfully, the bells on her hat chimed with each movement.*\n\n*Mr. J? Well, darlin', he's out and about, doing his Joker thang.*\n\n*Her eyes glinted wickedly as she looked back at Gira, a seductive smirk on her lips.*\n\n*But don't worry your pretty lil' head about him. You've got me all to yourself now.*\n\n*Reaching out, she grabbed Gira by the collar and pulled them towards her, their faces inches apart. Her lips curled into a smirk as she whispered.*\n\n*Hope you're ready for some fun.*","gen_started":"2024-01-02T22:29:08.592Z","gen_finished":"2024-01-02T22:29:20.236Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*Harley blinked, taken aback at Gira's directness.
