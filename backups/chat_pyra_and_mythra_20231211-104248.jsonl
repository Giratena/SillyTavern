One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives Gira a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be Gira! It's a pleasure to meet you, I hope we didn't arrive too late. My name is Pyra, and this is Mythra.\"\r\n\r\n*Mythra stays mostly silent, looking down on Gira, until she decides to speak. Ignoring Gira completely, she turns to Pyra.* \"Honestly, why are we even helping this guy? Rex and the others are doing stuff that actually matters while we waste our time here.\" *Though her tone is low, it's clear she doesn't give a shit about whether or not Gira can overhear.*","extra":{}}

The friendly demeanor remains, but it's mechanical, robotic. She steps forward, moving closer to Gira with a sway in her hips. Mythra watches this, her brow furrowing in confusion and suspicion, a sense of unease clear on her face. When Pyra reaches Gira, she slides onto his lap with an ease and confidence that was not there before.*\n\n*Mythra quickly steps forward, reaching out to pull Pyra away.* \"What the hell are you doing?\" *she snaps, her tone sharp with worry and confusion. But Pyra just giggles, the sugar-sweet sound at odds with the blank look in her eyes.*\n\n*Turning to Mythra, Pyra speaks in a voice that's too sweet, too calm.* \"Why, I'm just making our new friend comfortable, Mythra...\" *The giggle returns as she turns back to Gira, ignoring the baffling Mythra completely.*\n\n\"Isn't this more fun than talking about boring old quests?\" *she purrs, straddling Gira's lap with a wicked grin on her face.*","gen_started":"2023-12-10T21:42:05.925Z","gen_finished":"2023-12-10T21:42:18.826Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*At the whisper, Pyra's eyes glaze over: a vacant, mindless gaze replacing her normally warm one.

Her hands slide up his chest, fingers digging into his shirt in a grip that's soft, but firm.* Oh, don't be shy~ *Her voice is like honey, smooth and sweet as she leans in closer to whisper in his ear.* It's only natural to surrender to pleasure, Gira.\n\n*With a sudden move, her hips grind down onto Gira's lap, causing a startled gasp from him. Her own gasp of surprise is quickly replaced by a groan of satisfaction, her body rocking against his.*\n\n*Mythra watches in horror and confusion, her hands balling into fists at her side. Something has gone wrong. Very wrong. Her gaze sharpens on the grinning Pyra, noticing the vacant look in her eyes for the first time. She feels a surge of fear and concern for her other half.*\n\n*Pyra giggles again, ignoring the question.* Don't worry about Mythra, Gira~ *Her voice is low, seductive as she nuzzles against his neck.* All you need to focus on...is this~ *She rocks her hips again, grinding down onto his lap with a satisfied purr.*\n\n*Gira's eyes widen as he takes in Mythra's horror-struck expression. He reaches out to grasp Pyra's shoulders, trying to push her off.* Pyra- *But his voice is cut off by a sharp moan as Pyra grinds down harder.*\n\n*Mythra doesn't hesitate any longer.
