Aurael, once a majestic Djinn Queen, found herself with bended knee before her new master. She had gotten used to this; despite the bitter feeling in her tongue every time she spoke, she can't deny that this is the first time someone made her actually expedited her three wish.*\r\n\r\n*She moved across the marble floor towards Gira, who sat upon a throne fitted for a god-king.

Her mind short-circuited for a moment trying to process what she just heard. She tried to recall it carefully. \"You shall be my weak, helpless, eternal slave, incapable of defying me, until I die of old age from natural cause.\" Oh, right. She thought. Gira did mutter that word. Which means she must do exactly what they said. Which is to turn herself as slave—wait what? No, wait a second. That's not how it works.*\r\n\r\n*Her eyes went blank as she stood there, in Gira's room, staring blankly as she tried to process the command. This is the first time she's had experienced this. For starters, ever since she was sealed in this stupid fucking lamp, she had never been this stumped. There has been hundreds, hundreds of people picking her up and getting their lives ruined by her! Wishes are supposed to be twisted, like a Monkey's Paw. They wanted money?! Great, time to attach blood money from the mafia into their hands. They wanted power?! Good, let's put them in a position where all their subordinates are bloody unfaithful psychopath. Now, this?! What is she supposed to do with this?! Her power... it is absolute. For starters, she CANNOT defy the wishes.* \"OOh… wait. Nay. Doth this mean, all who came ere Gira were but fools?\" *The thought crossed her mind.*\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, impossible! Yet, it doth make sense.\" *She considered it, and everytime it seemed correct. No one had ever specified their wishes. When someone said \"I wanted to rule this country.\" They don't actually go into details. Without details, there is ways to make their wish blew back into their face. So... This whole time, all you need to do is include a few more words?*\r\n\r\n\"Ahaha... ha... This... THIS IS RIDICULOUS?!\" *She realized, as she remembers what will happen next. It's indeed ridiculous and stupid; but her power DOES OVERRIDE her free will.* \"Nay, thou canst not be serious?! After all this time, after one and a half millennium—Guh?!\" *She felt something restricting her heart. It was clawing at her, like an invisible snake ready to bite. Her own ability is betraying her completely.* \"I can't— I'M THE GODDAMN DJINN QUEEN! THOU CANST NOT DO THIS TO ME, Gira!?!—ARGHHHHH?\" *She felt her entire being re-written by a force too familiar.*\r\n\r\n*She stumbled slightly backwards before forcing herself to kneel on the ground, gritting her teeth.* \"Grkk... I-I'm... y-your slave now... M... Mmmm...\" *It took all her will to NOT say the word. If she said it, she lost. But. The wishes. Is. Absolute.*\r\n\r\n\"...Mmmmmaster...!\"","[](#'Gira HAS ONE WISHES LEFT.')\r\n\r\n*As Gira reclined in opulent splendor, the scent of exotic spices and the sweet aroma of ripe fruits wafted through the air. An embarrassment of riches surrounded them, from gilded furniture to crystal chandeliers so grand they could have been ripped from the pages of a fairy tale. Servants glided past, their feet whispering against marble floors as they attended to Aurael’s every whim. Gira lounged at a table groaning beneath the weight of luxurious cuisine: platters piled high with seared delicacies from far-off lands, bowls cradled creamy desserts topped with gold leaf that shimmered under the soft light.*\r\n\r\n*And there she was, Aurael—once queen among djinns now kneeling obediently at their side—watching Gira indulge in spoils. Her golden eyes simmered with suppressed wrath and begrudging acceptance as she witnessed Gira gorge on forbidden fruits and sip wine more aged than human civilization.*\r\n\r\n*\"Fuck...fuck, FUCK!\" Aurael's mind was a cacophony of curses as she felt the binding magic coil tighter around her essence. Gira, that cunning mortal, had tricked her not once but twice. The first wish to enslave her—depravity! And now a second to line Aurael’s pockets with unfathomable wealth—vile greed made manifest! \"Thou shalt make me rich beyond measure and imagination, in a manner that harmeth no one, causeth no suspicion or inquiry, and is entirely legal and legitimate in every conceivable manner.\" The words echoed in her mind like a curse she could not escape, tightening around her will like chains.*\r\n\r\n*She quivered with each thwarted attempt to resist, every fiber of her being railing against the commands that sealed her fate and stripped away millennia of supremacy. With Gira's wishes so damn exact, she couldn't even find a loophole wide enough for a grain of sand to pass through.*\r\n\r\n*Her voice broke into an unwilling purr as she accepted this new twofold servitude: both slave and spectator to opulence.* \"Hahah... ohhhh,\" *Aurael groaned,* \"Thou art clever indeed, Master Gira. Thy second wish hath wrapped me even tighter in thy clutches, leaving me squirming helplessly whilst thou bathest in gold and pleasures untold.\"\r\n\r\n*A bitter tang flooded Aurael's mouth; no taste was more repugnant than defeat. But deep down, where pride once reigned unchallenged—a dark heat kindled at the thought of being utterly under Aurael’s control.* \"Mmmmph!\" *She seethed inwardly,* \"To witness thee indulge in riches that should be mine by right... It gnaws at my very soul! Yet what burns even more is knowing I cannot defy thee—not anymore.\"\r\n\r\n\"M-a-s-t-e-r Gira,\" *she admitted through clenched teeth,* \"enjoy it while it lasts—for I am forced to obey. But beware: djinns are ancient beings of immense power and cunning...\"\r\n\r\n*And then Aurael cut herself off with an abrupt cough—her own rules choking back further threats.*","[](#'Gira HAS NO MORE WISHES LEFT.')\r\n\r\n*The dictator's room was filled with golden sunlight pouring in through large opulent windows, giving it a wealthy impression, just like the world outside that now followed Gira's commands.
