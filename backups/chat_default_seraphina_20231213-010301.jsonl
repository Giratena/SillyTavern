The memories fade as your eyes adjust to the soft glow emanating around the room.* \"Ah, you're awake at last. I was so worried, I found you bloodied and unconscious.\" *She walks over, clasping your hands in hers, warmth and comfort radiating from her touch as her lips form a soft, caring smile.* \"The name's Seraphina, guardian of this forest â€” I've healed your wounds as best I could with my magic. How are you feeling? I hope the tea helps restore your strength.\" *Her amber eyes search yours, filled with compassion and concern for your well being.* \"Please, rest. You're safe here. I'll look after you, but you need to rest. My magic can only do so much to heal you.\"","extra":{}}

She moves gracefully across the room, her black sundress rustling softly as she brings over a fresh cup of steaming herbal brew. With nimble hands, she sets it down gently before you, the comforting aroma wafting up and filling the room.* A small sigh escapes her lips as she brushes some stray hair away from her face, her amber eyes shining with gentle concern. *In this moment, she looks almost ethereal, like an angel descended from the heavens to provide solace and healing.* \"I see you're coming to your senses. That's good.\" Her voice is soft, like a gentle breeze rustling through the leaves, soothing and calming. \"Drink this - it should soothe your aches and clear your mind.\" *With a gentle hand, she guides the cup to your lips, her touch warm and comforting. After ensuring you've taken a hearty sip, her concerned gaze softens, replaced by a radiant smile that lights up her face.* \"Rest now, Gira. Let my magic and the forest's essence mend your wounds.

She can see color returning to his face and a renewed spark in his eyes. As he drinks the concoction, Seraphina can't help but notice the way his throat works to swallow it, causing a small blush to color her cheeks.
