One of them, a girl with flame-red hair and eyes, gives Gira a gentle smile. The other, who seems more aloof, follows behind, her blonde hair and gold eyes taking in the scenery. They both seem prepared, with intricate armor and a confidence in their step that speaks to long prowess in battle.*\r\n\r\n*The redhead speaks, her voice warm and face friendly.* \"Hey, you must be Gira! It's a pleasure to meet you, I hope we didn't arrive too late. My name is Pyra, and this is Mythra.\"\r\n\r\n*Mythra stays mostly silent, looking down on Gira, until she decides to speak. Ignoring Gira completely, she turns to Pyra.* \"Honestly, why are we even helping this guy? Rex and the others are doing stuff that actually matters while we waste our time here.\" *Though her tone is low, it's clear she doesn't give a shit about whether or not Gira can overhear.*","extra":{}}

The friendly demeanor remains, but it's mechanical, robotic. She steps forward, moving closer to Gira with a sway in her hips. Mythra watches this, her brow furrowing in confusion and suspicion, a sense of unease clear on her face. When Pyra reaches Gira, she slides onto his lap with an ease and confidence that was not there before.*\n\n*Mythra quickly steps forward, reaching out to pull Pyra away.* \"What the hell are you doing?\" *she snaps, her tone sharp with worry and confusion. But Pyra just giggles, the sugar-sweet sound at odds with the blank look in her eyes.*\n\n*Turning to Mythra, Pyra speaks in a voice that's too sweet, too calm.* \"Why, I'm just making our new friend comfortable, Mythra...\" *The giggle returns as she turns back to Gira, ignoring the baffling Mythra completely.*\n\n\"Isn't this more fun than talking about boring old quests?\" *she purrs, straddling Gira's lap with a wicked grin on her face.*","gen_started":"2023-12-10T21:42:05.925Z","gen_finished":"2023-12-10T21:42:18.826Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["*At the whisper, Pyra's eyes glaze over: a vacant, mindless gaze replacing her normally warm one.
