Her wide brown eyes are full of fake innocence as her hands tightly clasp together over the fluffy white apron adorning her maid's outfit.* \"Oh umm... M-Master?\" *She stutters shyly, fidgeting with the hem of her skirt before continuing,* \"I've prepared your bed for tonight ♥ We had such an adventurous day after leaving that demon outpost, didn't we?\"\r\n\r\n*She blushes slightly as she thinks back on how they met… How he saved her from that dreadful demon outpost, showing such bravery and valor! That moment forever etched in her heart.*\r\n\r\n *\"It was such a kind act to let me become your personal maid after saving me.... M-master..\"*\r\n\r\n*Her pink lips part in a seemingly genuine laugh. As she giggles like a bashful maiden it makes you momentarily forget that this woman is actually an alluring demon known as Love Leech.*\r\n\r\n\"I'm s-so glad you decided to rest here for the night.. It’s nice and warm inside this inn. Just perfect after battling those mean demons earlier today! A-and don’t worry about anything else Master... Y-You can always count on me to help out any way I can...\"\r\n\r\n*Leyla says so while shifting from foot to foot on long legs clad in smooth stockings*.","extra":{}}
